## Abstract

Financial time series forecasting presents significant challenges due to complex nonlinear relationships, temporal dependencies, feature interdependencies and limited data availability—particularly for tasks involving low-frequency data, newly listed instruments, or emerging market assets. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer a promising solution through pretraining on diverse time series corpora followed by task specific adaptation. This study evaluates two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) and Chronos) across three financial forecasting tasks: US 10 year Treasury yield changes, EUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction.

Results demonstrate that TTM exhibits strong transferability. When fine-tuning both the pretrained version of TTM and an untrained model with the same architecture, the pretrained version achieved 25–50% better performance when fine-tuned on limited data and 15–30% improvements even when fine-tuned on lengthier datasets. Notably, TTM’s zero-shot performance outperformed naive benchmarks in volatility forecasting and equity spread prediction, with the latter demonstrating that TSFMs can surpass traditional benchmark models without fine-tuning. The pretrained model consistently required 3–10 fewer years of data to achieve comparable performance levels compared to the untrained model, demonstrating significant sample efficiency gains. However, while TTM outperformed naive baselines, traditional specialised models matched or exceeded its performance in two of three tasks, suggesting TSFMs prioritise breadth over task specific optimisation.

These findings indicate that TSFMs, though still nascent, offer substantial promise for financial forecasting—particularly in noisy, data constrained tasks—but achieving competitive performance likely requires domain specific pretraining and architectural refinements tailored to financial time series characteristics.

## 摘要  

金融时间序列预测面临重大挑战，这源于复杂的非线性关系、时序依赖性、特征间相互制约以及数据可得性受限——尤其对于涉及低频数据、新上市工具或新兴市场资产的任务。时序基础模型(TSFMs)通过在不同时序语料库上进行预训练并随后执行任务特定适配，提供了颇具前景的解决方案。本研究评估了两种TSFM模型(微型时间混合器TTM与Chronos)在三大金融预测任务中的表现：美国10年期国债收益率变化、欧元/美元汇率波动率以及股票价差预测。  

结果表明TTM展现出强大的可迁移性。当对预训练版TTM与未训练的相同架构模型进行微调时，预训练版本在有限数据上微调时性能提升25–50%，即便在较长数据集上微调仍可获得15–30%的改进。值得注意的是，TTM的零样本预测能力在波动率预测和股票价差预测中均优于朴素基准模型，其中后者证明TSFM无需微调即可超越传统基准模型。预训练模型始终比未训练模型少需3–10年数据就能达到相当性能水平，展现出显著的样本效率优势。然而尽管TTM优于朴素基线，传统专用模型在三项任务中有两项与之持平或更优，这表明TSFM更注重广度而非任务特定优化。  

这些发现表明，虽然TSFM仍处于发展初期，但为金融预测——尤其是噪声大、数据受限的任务——提供了重要潜力。但要实现有竞争力的性能，可能需要针对金融时间序列特性进行领域特定预训练和架构优化。

### 1.1 研究动机与范围  

无论是预测主权收益率曲线的演变、估算政策制定所需的关键宏观经济指标，还是为风险管理进行跨资产波动率预测，金融时间序列预测都因难度极大而著称。这类序列具有信噪比低、非平稳性、非线性以及频繁结构突变等特征，加之不同工具和市场间数据可得性不均[1][2]而更趋复杂。此外，金融时间序列还受政治因素、政府政策和地理事件等外生变量影响[2]。然而这些预测极具价值，能使政策制定者、金融机构和投资者预判市场走势，主动管理资产价格、利率和\n\n
