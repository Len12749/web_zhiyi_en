Standard errors are in parentheses. $\\beta^{*}$ and $\\beta$ are the risk-neutral and actual rates of volatility mean reversion, estimated from options and time series data, respectively. $\\mathrm{SV/SVJD}$ are the unconstrained estimates of the parameters (and spot variances) implicit in option prices, using the log likelihood function $\\ln\\bar{L}_{\\mathrm{options}}$ . The maximum likelihood parameter estimates (using $\\ln_{H_{V}}$ Of the stochastic volatility process followed by the resulting time series of implicit spot variances $\\{V_{t}\\}$ are also reported. SvC/sVJDC are the constrained estimates of the parameters and (implicit spot variances) under the constraint $\\{\\alpha,\\sigma_{\\nu}\\}_{\\mathrm{options}}=\\{\\alpha,$ $\\sigma_{\\nu}\\}$ time series, using the log likelihood function $L_{\\mathrm{options}}+\\ln{L_{\\{V\\}}}$ Imposition of parameter constraints across options and time series also affects (smooths) the estimated time series of implicit spot variances $\\{V_{i}^{\\bar{\\epsilon}}\\}$ . The maximum likelihood parameter estimates (using In $L_{\\{V\\}})$ of the stochastic volatility process followed by the resulting time series of smoothed implicit spot variances $\\{V_{t}^{c}\\}$ are also reported for unconstrained $\\pmb{\\alpha}$ and $\\sigma_{v}$\n\n<!-- Page:24 -->\n\nloss function for testing hypotheses is\n\n$$\n\\ln L(\\{V_t\\}, \\theta, \\beta) = \\ln L_{\\text{options}} + \\ln L_{V} \\tag{30}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\ln{\\cal L}_{\\text{options}}(\\{V_{t}\\},\\theta)$ is the function of option pricing residuals given in Equation (26), and $\\ln L_{\\{V\\}}=\\Sigma_{t}\\ln{{p(\\ln(2c V_{t})\\mid\\alpha,\\beta,\\sigma_{\\nu};~V_{t-1})}}$ is the log-likelihood of an estimated $\\{V_{t}\\}$ sample path given $p(\\cdot)$ from Equation (29).\n\nThe likelihood function was again estimated by sequential maximization over process and covariance parameters, iterated to convergence. The joint hypothesis of identical $\\{\\alpha,\\sigma_{\\nu}\\}$ parameters for options and time series was tested using a likelihood ratio test:\n\nUnconstrained parameter estimates: ($\\{V\\}$, $\\lambda^*$, $k^*$, $\\delta$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta^*$, $\\sigma_{\\nu}$, $\\pi_{\\text{options}}$, $\\phi_{\\alpha}$, $\\beta$, $\\sigma_{\\nu}$ for time series)\nConstrained parameter estimates: ($\\{V\\}$, $\\lambda^*$, $k^*$, $\\delta$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\beta^*$, $\\sigma_{\\nu}$ for options & time series)\n\nThe effects of imposing the constraint that spot variance estimates be plausible are shown in Table 5, models SVC and SVJDC, and in Figure 2. Constraining the volatility process brought the volatility of variance parameter $\\sigma_{v}$ more in line with the time series behavior of $\\{V_{t}^{\\mathrm{c}}\\}$ and smoothed the estimated sample paths of $\\{V_{t}^{\\mathrm{c}}\\}$ . In fact, constrained estimation actually increased the joint log-likelihood of the stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model. The unconstrained $\\{V_{t}\\}$ sample path estimated from options (svJD model) without regard for time series plausibility was in fact highly unlikely for low (and low-volatility) values of $V_{t}$ , for which transition densities were nearly degenerate.\n\nNevertheless, both the stochastic volatility and the stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion models indicate substantial inconsistency between option prices and the underlying implicit volatility process. The constraint of identical $\\{\\alpha,\\sigma_{\\nu}\\}$ parameters in the options and resulting $\\{V_{t}\\}$ time series data for the sV model is strongly rejected, based on two criteria: (1) the worsening of the joint log-likelihood (120,733 versus 120,807\u2014 $\\cdot p$ -value $<10^{-16}$); and (2) the inconsistency of the constrained $\\{V_{t}^{\\mathrm{c}}\\}$ implicit parameters $\\{\\alpha,\\sigma_{\\nu}\\}$ and the constrained sample path {V\u00a7} (log-likelihood 243 versus 175\u2014p-value <\u03b210-16). The latter criterion also yields rejection of the SVJDC model (log-likelihood of 225 versus 215\u2014 $\\cdot p$ -value $=6\\times10^{-5}$). A comparison of the SvC and SVJDC models indicates that the implicit jump component continues to be strongly significant ($\\mathcal{p}$ -value $<10^{-16}$)\n\nThe rejections indicate that the stochastic volatility model is consistent with the \u201cvolatility smile\" evidence of implicit leptokurtosis only for extreme and implausible levels of the volatility of variance. The implausibility of the high $\\sigma_{\\nu}$ estimated under the sV model is\n\n<!-- Page:25 -->\n\n<center><i>Figure 2: Unconstrained and constrained spot volatilities implicit in deutsche mark options, 1984-1991.

A high volatility of variance implies frequent reflections off zero and substantial clustering of implicit instantaneous variances near 0, contrary to what is observed. The SVJDC model by contrast is more compatible with a plausible stochastic variance process, and attributes the implicit leptokurtosis to a jump component of substantial amplitude and biannual frequency similar to that estimated for the deterministic volatility/jump-diffusion model in Table 2.\n\nPrevious studies have argued that the term structure of implicit volatilities is inconsistent with the time series properties of implicit volatilities.$^{24}$ Particular attention has been drawn to the discrepancy between the long half-life to volatility shocks implicit in the term structure of implicit volatilities relative to observed faster mean reversion in implicit volatilities. In this model, the term structure of implicit expected average variances for 0- to 3-month versus 3- to 6-month options depends on the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2*; see Equation (27). Since the expected average variance is roughly the implicit variance from\n\n---\n\n4 Stein (1989) makes this argument with regard to implicit volatilities from S&P 100 options, while Campa and Chang (1995) examine interbank foreign currency options.\n\n<!-- Page:26 -->\n\n<center><i>Figure3 Theoretical and sample histograms for spot variances, 1984-1991, stochastic volatility (sv)model</i></center>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/b1e2c77fd32db8779e9e467c54373031b10f2c3e4ee0e387757458949ec93921.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 70%;\" />\n</div>\n\nthe Black-Scholes model,$^{25}$ the question is whether the $(\\alpha, \\beta^{*})$ parameters implicit in option prices are consistent with the $\\langle\\alpha,\\beta\\rangle$ parameters estimated from the AR(1) time series model for implicit variances.",
"text_b": "The two sets of parameters do in fact diverge in unconstrained parameter estimation. However, the parameters can in principle diverge because of a volatility risk premium. Furthermore, the subsample estimates reported in Table 4 suggest that the full-sample estimates of $\\langle\\alpha,\\beta^{*}\\rangle$ were heavily influenced by the unusual term structure of implicit spot variances during the 1984 to 1985 period. Subsequent subsample estimates from 1986 to 1991 appear more compatible with the time series behavior of spot implicit variances in terms of the steadystate level and the rate of reversion toward that level.\n\n### 3.2 Tests of consistency with the time series properties of futures prices\n\nA further test of the stochastic volatility and stochastic volatility/jumpdiffusion models is their consistency or inconsistency with observed realizations of exchange rates and foreign currency futures prices. To examine this, the actual (as opposed to risk-neutral) futures price\n\n---\n\n25 In principle, there are Jensen's inequality biases relevant to the choice of implicit volatilies versus implicit variances and to the choice of the moneyness of the options used in computing implicit volatilities. These biases do not appear empirically important for plausible o, and jump parameters.\n\n<!-- Page:27 -->\n\nprocess was parameterized as follows:\n\n<!-- Page:28 -->\n\ninstantaneous variance was modeled as a linear transform of the instantaneous variance realization implicit in option prices:\n\n$$\nV_{t}=c u_{0}+c\\nu_{1}V_{t}^{\\text{options}},\\quad c u_{0}\\ge0\\qquad(37)\n$$\n\nwhere the coefficients $c u_{\\mathrm{0}}$ and $c{\\nu_{1}}$ were estimated. The actual (as opposed to risk-neutral jump parameters were also estimated, as were the influences of interest differentials and instantaneous volatility. Since option prices provide no direct information about the true rate of variance mean reversion, \u03b2 was initially treated as a free parameter to be estimated from futures data. Parameters were estimated, first treating jump volatility $\\delta$ as a free parameter, and subsequently constraining it to the value implicit in option prices. The former is more comparable methodologically with time series studies such as Akgiray and Booth (1988) and Jorion (1988), who have found highfrequency, low-amplitude exchange rate jump components of little significance for 1- to 6-month option prices. Estimation of the latter constrains jump amplitudes to values relevant at typical option maturities, permits explicit testing of that constraint, and is of course theoretically correct.\n\nThe futures data were short-maturity (typically 0 to 3 month) noon quotes on Wednesdays for which there were options data available. The typical time interval was 1 week, although there were five occasions in which missing options data resulted in a longer time interval. To avoid maturity shifts, the futures contract maturity was the shortest maturity such that futures contracts with identical delivery dates existed at the next available Wednesday.26 One-month Eurocurrency interest rates were used for the interest differential.\n\nMaximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters are presented in Table 6A. As has been found elsewhere, estimates of the conditional mean suggest that it is the spot exchange rate rather than the futures price that follows a martingale, although neither hypothesis can be rejected in this single-currency regression.27 No statistically significant jump component was found. The hypothesis that implicit volatilities provide no useful information in forecasting future volatilities was strongly rejected for $\\{V_{t}^{\\text{options}}\\}$ sample paths estimated from both the\n\n---\n\n26 For example, June 1984 options on March 5, 1984, were used to predict the March 1984 futures price transition from March 5 to March 12. On March 12, June 1984 options were used to predict the June 1984 futures price transition from March 12 to March 19.\n\n27 See Hodrick (1987)and Froot and Thaler (1990) for surveys of the extensive literature on rejections of uncovered interest parity, which is equivalent to rejection of the hypothesis that the futures price follows a martingale. The strongest rejections of uncovered interest parity have been within a multicurrency framework [e.g., Hsieh (1984).\n\n<!-- Page:29 -->\n\nIumps and Stocbastic Volatility: Excbange Rate Processes Implicit inDeutscbe Mark Options\n\n<!-- Page:30 -->\n\n<center><i>Table6 Maximum likelihood estimates of the \\$/DM futures price process conditional on parameters and instantaneous conditional variances implicit in options prices </i></center>\n\n| Model | $\\lambda$ | $\\bar{k}$ | $\\delta$ | $\\sqrt{V_{jump}}$ | $\\beta$ | $c_0$ | $c_1$ | $c_v$ | $cv_0$ | $cv_1$ | $\\ln L_{\\{F\\}}$ | $cv_0 = 0,$ $cv_1 = 0$ | $cv_1 = 1$ |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| A.

Standard errors are in parentheses. $\\beta^{*}$ and $\\beta$ are the risk-neutral and actual rates of volatility mean reversion, estimated from options and time series data, respectively. $\\mathrm{SV/SVJD}$ are the unconstrained estimates of the parameters (and spot variances) implicit in option prices, using the log likelihood function $\\ln\\bar{L}_{\\mathrm{options}}$ . The maximum likelihood parameter estimates (using $\\ln_{H_{V}}$ Of the stochastic volatility process followed by the resulting time series of implicit spot variances $\\{V_{t}\\}$ are also reported. SvC/sVJDC are the constrained estimates of the parameters and (implicit spot variances) under the constraint $\\{\\alpha,\\sigma_{\\nu}\\}_{\\mathrm{options}}=\\{\\alpha,$ $\\sigma_{\\nu}\\}$ time series, using the log likelihood function $L_{\\mathrm{options}}+\\ln{L_{\\{V\\}}}$ Imposition of parameter constraints across options and time series also affects (smooths) the estimated time series of implicit spot variances $\\{V_{i}^{\\bar{\\epsilon}}\\}$ . The maximum likelihood parameter estimates (using In $L_{\\{V\\}})$ of the stochastic volatility process followed by the resulting time series of smoothed implicit spot variances $\\{V_{t}^{c}\\}$ are also reported for unconstrained $\\pmb{\\alpha}$ and $\\sigma_{v}$\n\n<!-- Page:24 -->\n\nloss function for testing hypotheses is\n\n$$\n\\ln L(\\{V_t\\}, \\theta, \\beta) = \\ln L_{\\text{options}} + \\ln L_{V} \\tag{30}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\ln{\\cal L}_{\\text{options}}(\\{V_{t}\\},\\theta)$ is the function of option pricing residuals given in Equation (26), and $\\ln L_{\\{V\\}}=\\Sigma_{t}\\ln{{p(\\ln(2c V_{t})\\mid\\alpha,\\beta,\\sigma_{\\nu};~V_{t-1})}}$ is the log-likelihood of an estimated $\\{V_{t}\\}$ sample path given $p(\\cdot)$ from Equation (29).\n\nThe likelihood function was again estimated by sequential maximization over process and covariance parameters, iterated to convergence. The joint hypothesis of identical $\\{\\alpha,\\sigma_{\\nu}\\}$ parameters for options and time series was tested using a likelihood ratio test:\n\nUnconstrained parameter estimates: ($\\{V\\}$, $\\lambda^*$, $k^*$, $\\delta$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta^*$, $\\sigma_{\\nu}$, $\\pi_{\\text{options}}$, $\\phi_{\\alpha}$, $\\beta$, $\\sigma_{\\nu}$ for time series)\nConstrained parameter estimates: ($\\{V\\}$, $\\lambda^*$, $k^*$, $\\delta$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\beta^*$, $\\sigma_{\\nu}$ for options & time series)\n\nThe effects of imposing the constraint that spot variance estimates be plausible are shown in Table 5, models SVC and SVJDC, and in Figure 2. Constraining the volatility process brought the volatility of variance parameter $\\sigma_{v}$ more in line with the time series behavior of $\\{V_{t}^{\\mathrm{c}}\\}$ and smoothed the estimated sample paths of $\\{V_{t}^{\\mathrm{c}}\\}$ . In fact, constrained estimation actually increased the joint log-likelihood of the stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model. The unconstrained $\\{V_{t}\\}$ sample path estimated from options (svJD model) without regard for time series plausibility was in fact highly unlikely for low (and low-volatility) values of $V_{t}$ , for which transition densities were nearly degenerate.\n\nNevertheless, both the stochastic volatility and the stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion models indicate substantial inconsistency between option prices and the underlying implicit volatility process. The constraint of identical $\\{\\alpha,\\sigma_{\\nu}\\}$ parameters in the options and resulting $\\{V_{t}\\}$ time series data for the sV model is strongly rejected, based on two criteria: (1) the worsening of the joint log-likelihood (120,733 versus 120,807\u2014 $\\cdot p$ -value $<10^{-16}$); and (2) the inconsistency of the constrained $\\{V_{t}^{\\mathrm{c}}\\}$ implicit parameters $\\{\\alpha,\\sigma_{\\nu}\\}$ and the constrained sample path {V\u00a7} (log-likelihood 243 versus 175\u2014p-value <\u03b210-16). The latter criterion also yields rejection of the SVJDC model (log-likelihood of 225 versus 215\u2014 $\\cdot p$ -value $=6\\times10^{-5}$). A comparison of the SvC and SVJDC models indicates that the implicit jump component continues to be strongly significant ($\\mathcal{p}$ -value $<10^{-16}$)\n\nThe rejections indicate that the stochastic volatility model is consistent with the \u201cvolatility smile\" evidence of implicit leptokurtosis only for extreme and implausible levels of the volatility of variance. The implausibility of the high $\\sigma_{\\nu}$ estimated under the sV model is\n\n<!-- Page:25 -->\n\n<center><i>Figure 2: Unconstrained and constrained spot volatilities implicit in deutsche mark options, 1984-1991.

A high volatility of variance implies frequent reflections off zero and substantial clustering of implicit instantaneous variances near 0, contrary to what is observed. The SVJDC model by contrast is more compatible with a plausible stochastic variance process, and attributes the implicit leptokurtosis to a jump component of substantial amplitude and biannual frequency similar to that estimated for the deterministic volatility/jump-diffusion model in Table 2.\n\nPrevious studies have argued that the term structure of implicit volatilities is inconsistent with the time series properties of implicit volatilities.$^{24}$ Particular attention has been drawn to the discrepancy between the long half-life to volatility shocks implicit in the term structure of implicit volatilities relative to observed faster mean reversion in implicit volatilities. In this model, the term structure of implicit expected average variances for 0- to 3-month versus 3- to 6-month options depends on the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2*; see Equation (27). Since the expected average variance is roughly the implicit variance from the Black-Scholes model,$^{25}$ the question is whether the $(\\alpha, \\beta^{*})$ parameters implicit in option prices are consistent with the $\\langle\\alpha,\\beta\\rangle$ parameters estimated from the AR(1) time series model for implicit variances.\n\n---\n\n4 Stein (1989) makes this argument with regard to implicit volatilities from S&P 100 options, while Campa and Chang (1995) examine interbank foreign currency options.\n\n25 In principle, there are Jensen's inequality biases relevant to the choice of implicit volatilies versus implicit variances and to the choice of the moneyness of the options used in computing implicit volatilities. These biases do not appear empirically important for plausible o, and jump parameters.",
"text_b": "\nThe two sets of parameters do in fact diverge in unconstrained parameter estimation. However, the parameters can in principle diverge because of a volatility risk premium. Furthermore, the subsample estimates reported in Table 4 suggest that the full-sample estimates of $\\langle\\alpha,\\beta^{*}\\rangle$ were heavily influenced by the unusual term structure of implicit spot variances during the 1984 to 1985 period. Subsequent subsample estimates from 1986 to 1991 appear more compatible with the time series behavior of spot implicit variances in terms of the steadystate level and the rate of reversion toward that level.\n\n### 3.2 Tests of consistency with the time series properties of futures prices\n\nA further test of the stochastic volatility and stochastic volatility/jumpdiffusion models is their consistency or inconsistency with observed realizations of exchange rates and foreign currency futures prices. To examine this, the actual (as opposed to risk-neutral) futures price\n\n<!-- Page:27 -->\n\nprocess was parameterized as follows:\n\n<!-- Page:28 -->\n\ninstantaneous variance was modeled as a linear transform of the instantaneous variance realization implicit in option prices:\n\n$$\nV_{t}=c u_{0}+c\\nu_{1}V_{t}^{\\text{options}},\\quad c u_{0}\\ge0\\qquad(37)\n$$\n\nwhere the coefficients $c u_{\\mathrm{0}}$ and $c{\\nu_{1}}$ were estimated. The actual (as opposed to risk-neutral jump parameters were also estimated, as were the influences of interest differentials and instantaneous volatility. Since option prices provide no direct information about the true rate of variance mean reversion, \u03b2 was initially treated as a free parameter to be estimated from futures data. Parameters were estimated, first treating jump volatility $\\delta$ as a free parameter, and subsequently constraining it to the value implicit in option prices. The former is more comparable methodologically with time series studies such as Akgiray and Booth (1988) and Jorion (1988), who have found highfrequency, low-amplitude exchange rate jump components of little significance for 1- to 6-month option prices. Estimation of the latter constrains jump amplitudes to values relevant at typical option maturities, permits explicit testing of that constraint, and is of course theoretically correct.\n\nThe futures data were short-maturity (typically 0 to 3 month) noon quotes on Wednesdays for which there were options data available. The typical time interval was 1 week, although there were five occasions in which missing options data resulted in a longer time interval. To avoid maturity shifts, the futures contract maturity was the shortest maturity such that futures contracts with identical delivery dates existed at the next available Wednesday.26 One-month Eurocurrency interest rates were used for the interest differential.\n\nMaximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters are presented in Table 6A. As has been found elsewhere, estimates of the conditional mean suggest that it is the spot exchange rate rather than the futures price that follows a martingale, although neither hypothesis can be rejected in this single-currency regression.27 No statistically significant jump component was found. The hypothesis that implicit volatilities provide no useful information in forecasting future volatilities was strongly rejected for $\\{V_{t}^{\\text{options}}\\}$ sample paths estimated from both the\n\n---\n\n26 For example, June 1984 options on March 5, 1984, were used to predict the March 1984 futures price transition from March 5 to March 12. On March 12, June 1984 options were used to predict the June 1984 futures price transition from March 12 to March 19.\n\n27 See Hodrick (1987)and Froot and Thaler (1990) for surveys of the extensive literature on rejections of uncovered interest parity, which is equivalent to rejection of the hypothesis that the futures price follows a martingale. The strongest rejections of uncovered interest parity have been within a multicurrency framework [e.g., Hsieh (1984).\n\n<!-- Page:29 -->\n\nIumps and Stocbastic Volatility: Excbange Rate Processes Implicit inDeutscbe Mark Options\n\n<!-- Page:30 -->\n\n<center><i>Table6 Maximum likelihood estimates of the \\$/DM futures price process conditional on parameters and instantaneous conditional variances implicit in options prices </i></center>\n\n| Model | $\\lambda$ | $\\bar{k}$ | $\\delta$ | $\\sqrt{V_{jump}}$ | $\\beta$ | $c_0$ | $c_1$ | $c_v$ | $cv_0$ | $cv_1$ | $\\ln L_{\\{F\\}}$ | $cv_0 = 0,$ $cv_1 = 0$ | $cv_1 = 1$ |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| A.
