Data\n\nThe joint spot and option data are from the Berkeley Options Data Base (BODB), a complete record of trading activity on the floor of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)\n\n### 4.1. S&P 500 index and near-the-money short-dated options\n\nWe construct a time-series $\\{S_{n},~C_{n}\\}$ of the S&P 500 index and near-the-money short-dated option prices, from January 1989 to December 1996, with \u2018\u2018weekly\u2019 frequency (every 5 trading days). This joint time-series is plotted in Fig. 1. The details of data collection are as follows\n\nFor each observation day, we collect all of the bid\u2013ask quotes (on both calls and puts) that are time-stamped in a pre-determined sampling window. The sampling window, always between 10:00 and $10{:}30\\mathrm{a.m.}$, varies from year to year. For example, it is set at $10{:}07{-}10{:}23\\mathrm{a.m}$ for all trading days in 1989; and at 10:14\u2013 10:16 a.m. for 1996.

Time series of in-the-money short-dated calls\n\nOn each date $n$ ; we select an in-the-money call $C_{n}^{\\mathrm{ITM}}$ with the same maturity as the near-the-money option $C_{n}$ described above, but a different strike price. Among all of the possible ITM call options (with strike price less than that of the near-the-money option $C_{n}$ ), we select the one $C_{n}^{\\mathrm{ITM}}$ with strike-to-spot ratio closest to 0.95.

The sample mean of the strike-to-spot ratio $\\{k_{n}^{\\mathrm{ITM}}\\}$ is 0.952, with a sample standard deviation of 0.007.\n\n### 4.3. Cross-sectional data on calls and puts\n\nWe select the 10 most and 10 least volatile days from the weekly sample between January 1989 and December 1996, as measured by the Black\u2013Scholes implied volatility.\n\n---\n\n17From September 11 to October 2, 1992, there is no October contract recorded in the BODB.

Near the end of 1995, the exchange did not adjust its grid of strike prices to reflect the steady upward movement of the S&P 500 index. During this period, the highest strike price available was well below the spot S&P 500 index.

The average Black\u2013Scholes implied volatility (BS vol) for the days of high, medium, and low volatilities are $25.1\\%$ , $13.6\\%$ , and $8.7\\%$ , respectively.",

This set of cross-sectional data is then filtered through the Black\u2013Scholes option-pricing formula to obtain the corresponding BS vol, discarding any observation from which the BS vol cannot be obtained. There is a total of 11,434 observations for the group of high-volatility days, 33,919 observations for the medium-volatility days, and 19,589 observations for the lowvolatility days.\n\n## 5. Empirical results\n\nThe estimation results are organized as follows. Section 5.1 focuses on the relative importance of jump- and volatility-risk premia in reconciling the joint time series $\\{S_{n},~C_{n}\\}$ of spot and option prices. Section 5.2 details a simultaneous estimation of the premia for jump and volatility risks, and evaluates the relative magnitude of these two types of risk premia, using an additional time series $\\{C_{n}^{\\mathrm{ITM}}\\}$ of in-themoney short-dated call options. Section 5.3 extends the analysis to the crosssectional option data, providing further evidence for jump-risk premia. Finally, Section 5.4 examines possible model mis-specifications and their implications on our findings of jump-risk premia. The estimation results associated with the risk-free rates $r$ and dividend yields $q$ ; as well as the results of a Monte-Carlo study, are presented in Appendix E.\n\n### 5.1. Reconciling spot and option dynamics\n\nIn order to examine the role of risk premia in reconciling spot and option dynamics, we focus on three nested models of Eqs. (2.1)\u2013(2.5):\n\n\\* The SVJ0 model: $\\eta^{v}=0$ : $\\bullet$ The SV model: $\\lambda=0$ : $\\bullet$ The SV0 model: $\\lambda=0$ and $\\eta^{v}=0$ :\n\nThese nested models are chosen to represent three different risk-premium structures: jump-risk premia (SVJ0), volatility-risk premia (SV), and no risk premia (SV0).\n\nFor all three models, we perform joint estimations of their actual and risk-neutral dynamics using the time series $\\{S_{n},~C_{n}\\}$ of the S&P 500 index and the near-themoney short-dated option prices. (See data collection details in Section 4.1.) The estimation results are reported in Table 1 and the results of goodness-of-fit tests are summarized in Table 2.

"text_b": "## 5. Empirical results\n\nThe estimation results are organized as follows. Section 5.1 focuses on the relative importance of jump- and volatility-risk premia in reconciling the joint time series $\\{S_{n},~C_{n}\\}$ of spot and option prices. Section 5.2 details a simultaneous estimation of the premia for jump and volatility risks, and evaluates the relative magnitude of these two types of risk premia, using an additional time series $\\{C_{n}^{\\mathrm{ITM}}\\}$ of in-themoney short-dated call options. Section 5.3 extends the analysis to the crosssectional option data, providing further evidence for jump-risk premia. Finally, Section 5.4 examines possible model mis-specifications and their implications on our findings of jump-risk premia. The estimation results associated with the risk-free rates $r$ and dividend yields $q$ ; as well as the results of a Monte-Carlo study, are presented in Appendix E.\n\n### 5.1. Reconciling spot and option dynamics\n\nIn order to examine the role of risk premia in reconciling spot and option dynamics, we focus on three nested models of Eqs. (2.1)\u2013(2.5):\n\n\\* The SVJ0 model: $\\eta^{v}=0$ : $\\bullet$ The SV model: $\\lambda=0$ : $\\bullet$ The SV0 model: $\\lambda=0$ and $\\eta^{v}=0$ :\n\nThese nested models are chosen to represent three different risk-premium structures: jump-risk premia (SVJ0), volatility-risk premia (SV), and no risk premia (SV0).\n\nFor all three models, we perform joint estimations of their actual and risk-neutral dynamics using the time series $\\{S_{n},~C_{n}\\}$ of the S&P 500 index and the near-themoney short-dated option prices. (See data collection details in Section 4.1.) The estimation results are reported in Table 1 and the results of goodness-of-fit tests are summarized in Table 2. The goodness-of-fit tests are constructed directly from the\n\n<!-- Page:16 -->\n\n<center><i>Table 1 IS-GMM estimates of three nested modelsa </i></center>\n\n|       | $\\kappa_{v}$ | $\\bar{v}$ | $\\sigma_{v}$ | $\\rho$ | $\\eta^{s}$ | $\\eta^{v}$ | $\\lambda$ | $\\mu$ (%) | $\\sigma_{J}$ (%) | $\\mu^{*}$ (%) |\n|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| SVJ0  | 7.1 | 0.0134 | 0.28 | $-0.52$ | 3.1 | $\\equiv0$ | 27.1 | $-0.3$ | 3.25 | $-18.0$ |\n|       | (1.9) | (0.0029) | (0.04) | (0.07) | (2.9) | | (11.8) | (1.7) | (0.64) | (1.6) |\n| SV    | 7.1 | 0.0137 | 0.32 | $-0.53$ | 8.6 | 7.6 | $\\equiv0$ | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n|       | (2.1) | (0.0023) | (0.03) | (0.06) | (2.3) | (2.0) | | | | |\n| SV0   | 5.3 | 0.0242 | 0.38 | $-0.57$ | 4.4 | $\\equiv0$ | $\\equiv0$ | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n|       | (1.9) | (0.0044) | (0.04) | (0.05) | (1.8) | | | | | |\n\n<center>\n<div style=\"display: inline-block; text-align: left; max-width: 80%;\">\n<i>a Data: Weekly spot and options data, S&P 500 index, Jan. 1989\u2013Dec. 1996. </i>\n</div>\n</center>\n\n<center><i>Table 2 Goodness-of-fit tests </i></center>\n\n|                  | $\\tilde{\\epsilon}$ | SV0          | SV           | SVJ0         |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Individual tests | $y1$              | 1.46         | $-0.59$      | 0.27         |\n|                  | $y2$              | $-3.98^{**}$ | $-1.56$      | $-0.60$      |\n|                  | $y3$              | 0.77         | $-0.29$      | $-0.65$      |\n|                  | $y4$              | $-1.45$      | 0.27         | $-0.36$      |\n|                  | $v1$              | $-1.91$      | 1.80         | 0.95         |\n|                  | $v2$              | $-2.28^{*}$  | 1.24         | 0.59         |\n|                  | $yv$              | $2.47^{*}$   | $-0.10$      | 0.60         |\n| Joint tests      | All $y$           | $28.2^{**}$  | 8.1          | 1.8          |\n|                  | $\\chi^2$ (4)      | $(10^{-5})$  | $(0.09)$     | $(0.77)$     |\n|                  | All $v$           | $9.1^{*}$    | $11.4^{**}$  | 3.2          |\n|                  | $\\chi^2$ (2)      | $(0.01)$     | $(0.003)$    | $(0.20)$     |\n|                  | All               | $59.9^{**}$  | $31.6^{**}$  | 7.6          |\n|                  | $\\chi^2$ (7)      | $(10^{-10})$ | $(10^{-5})$  | $(0.37)$     |\n\n<center>\n<div style=\"display: inline-block; text-align: left; max-width: 80%;\">\n<i>n Indicate significance under a <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?5\\%\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; height: 1.2em;\" alt=\"5\\%\" class=\"latex-formula\"/> test. nn Indicate significance under a 1% test.
