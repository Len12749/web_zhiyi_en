However, the digital gap for the elderly has aroused a heated discussion. But I do not think the elders should be neglected in using new technologies.

Multiple measures should be carried out to help bridge the digital gap for older people and make sure they share in the benefits of a smart society. First, online medical services should be simplified, and voice - led guidance should be provided. This can help the elderly easily access medical resources without being confused by complex operations. Second, payment systems for retail, catering, shopping malls, parks and other basic public services such as water and electricity must not decline to accept cash payments. This ensures that the elderly who are not proficient in digital payment can still live conveniently. Last but not least, as young people, we should patiently help teach seniors to use smartphones and become more familiar with the internet and related services. We can spend some time every week showing them how to use common apps, such as those for chatting, shopping and taking buses.

Only by the above - mentioned measures can we effectively bridge the digital gap for old people and help them keep up with the pace of the digital era, enjoying the convenience brought by technology.\n\n===== 翻译提示词 =====\n\n请将以下文本翻译成中文。确保专业术语的准确翻译，保持Markdown格式和数学公式的正确性，保留表格占位符[TABLE_ID_数字]不变。请只输出翻译文本，不要添加任何解释或注释：

应采取多种措施帮助弥合老年人群体的数字鸿沟，确保他们共享智能社会的福利。首先，应简化在线医疗服务，并提供语音引导功能。这能帮助老年人轻松获取医疗资源，而不被复杂操作所困扰。其次，零售、餐饮、商场、公园等基础公共服务及水电费缴纳系统必须保留现金支付渠道。这确保了不擅长数字支付的老年人仍能便利生活。最后同样重要的是，作为年轻人，我们应当耐心教导老年人使用智能手机，帮助他们熟悉互联网及相关服务。我们可以每周抽出时间，向他们演示聊天、购物、乘车等常用应用程序的使用方法。

唯有通过上述措施，我们才能有效弥合老年人的数字鸿沟，帮助他们跟上数字时代的步伐，享受技术带来的便利。\n\n
