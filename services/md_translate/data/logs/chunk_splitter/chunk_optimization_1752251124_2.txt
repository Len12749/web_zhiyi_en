Our formulation of $r$ and $q$; however, precludes possible correlation between the two, as well as more plausible and richer dynamics for the short-rate process. But for the short-dated options used to fit our model, the particular stochastic nature of interest rates $r$ and dividend yields $q$ plays a relatively minor role.\n\nFinally, one limitation of our volatility specification is that it does not allow volatility to jump, a feature that is found to be important in stock returns (Eraker et al., 2000). In an issue that is related, Jones (1999) points out that, compared with the constant elastic variance (CEV) model, the square-root specification does not allow volatility to increase fast enough. The severity of these limitations will be investigated in Section 5.4 by diagnostic tests on the volatility dynamics. Their implications on our understanding of the jump-risk premia will also be discussed. Overall, to maintain a parsimonious model is the main reason why volatility jumps are not considered here, and the CEV specification is not incorporated for analytical tractability.$^{7}$\n\n### 2.2. The market prices of risks\n\nIn contrast to the complete market setting of Black and Scholes (1973), the additional sources of uncertainty, in particular, the random jump sizes, introduced in our setting make the market incomplete with respect to the riskfree bank account, the underlying stock, and the finite number of options contracts. Consequently, the stateprice density (or pricing kernel) is not unique. Our approach is to focus on a candidate pricing kernel that prices the three important sources of risks: diffusive price shocks, jump risks, and volatility shocks.$^{8}$ Given their mild effects on short-dated option prices, the interest-rate and dividend-rate risks are not priced in this paper.\n\nFor exposition purpose, we present in this section the \u2018\u2018risk-neutral\u2019\u2019 price dynamics defined by our candidate pricing kernel, leaving a detailed description of the pricing kernel in Appendix A. Letting $Q$ be the equivalent martingale measure\n\n---\n\n$^{7}$Alternative models also include the log-normal model of Hull and White (1987). In fact, using highfrequency stock return data, Andersen et al. (2001) suggest that volatility is best described as a log-normal process. One disadvantage of such a model, however, is that once the negative correlation between stock returns and volatility is incorporated, option pricing becomes intractable. Moreover, Benzoni (1998) shows that for the purpose of option pricing, there is no qualitative difference between the log-normal model and the square-root model. An alternative approach is preference-based equilbrium pricing, for which the state-price density arises from marginal rates of substitution evaluated at equilibrium consumption streams. See Lucas (1978). Also, see Naik and Lee (1990) for an extension to jumps, Pham and Touzi (1996) for an extension to stochastic volatility, and Detemple and Selden (1991) for an analysis of the interactions between options and stock markets.\n\n<!-- Page:6 -->\n\nassociated with our candidate pricing kernel, we assign the market prices of risks so that both $r$ and $q$ have the same joint distribution under $Q$ as under the datagenerating measure $P$ ; and the dynamics of $(S,V)$ under $Q$ are of the form\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}S_t = [r_t - q_t]S_t \\, \\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{V_t}S_t \\, \\mathrm{d}W_t^{(1)}(Q) + \\mathrm{d}Z_t^Q - \\mu^* S_t \\lambda V_t \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\tag{2.4}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{d} V_{t} = [\\kappa_{\\nu}(\\bar{v} - V_{t}) + \\eta^{\\nu} V_{t}] \\, \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma_{\\nu} \\sqrt{V_{t}} \\Big( \\rho \\, \\mathrm{d} W_{t}^{(1)}(\\mathcal{Q}) + \\sqrt{1 - \\rho^{2}} \\, \\mathrm{d} W_{t}^{(2)}(\\mathcal{Q}) \\Big), \\tag{2.5}\n$$\n\nwhere $W(Q)=[W^{(1)}(Q),W^{(2)}(Q)]$ is a standard Brownian motion under $Q$ : [See Appendix A for a formal definition of $W(Q).]$ The pure-jump process $Z^{Q}$ has a distribution under $Q$ that is identical to the distribution of $Z$ under $P$ defined in Eq. (2.1), except that under $Q$ ; the jump arrival intensity is $\\{\\lambda V_{t}:t\\geqslant0\\}$ for some non-negative constant $\\lambda$ ; and the jump amplitudes $U_{i}^{s}$ is normally distributed with $Q$ -mean $\\mu_{J}^{*}$ and $Q$ -variance $\\sigma_{J}^{2}$ : In other words, under the risk-neutral measure, the conditional probability at time $t$ of another jump before $t+\\Delta t$ is approximately $\\lambda V_{t}\\Delta t$ and, conditional on a jump event, the risk-neutral mean relative jump size is $\\mu^{*}=\\operatorname{E}^{Q}(\\exp{(U^{s})}-1)=\\exp(\\mu_{J}^{*}+\\sigma_{J}^{2}/2)-1$ : Following the same discussion for the data-generating process, we see that the last term $\\mu^{*}S_{t}\\lambda V_{t}\\mathrm{d}t$ in Eq. (2.4) is the compensator for the pure-jump process $Z^{Q}$ under the risk-neutral measure. Consequently, the instantaneous risk-neutral expected rate of stock return is the short interest rate $r$ minus the dividend payout rate $q$ :\n\nComparing the specification of the risk-neutral dynamics of $(S,V)$ with that of the data-generating process, one can obtain an intuitive understanding of how different risk factors are priced. Focusing first on the market prices of jump risks, we see that by allowing the risk-neutral mean relative jump size $\\mu^{*}$ to be different from its datagenerating counterpart $\\mu$ ; we accommodate a premium for jump-size uncertainty. Similarly, a premium for jump-timing risk can be incorporated if we allow the coefficient $\\lambda^{*}$ for the risk-neutral jump-arrival intensity to be different from its datagenerating counterpart $\\lambda$ : In this paper, however, we concentrate mainly on the risk premium for jump-size uncertainty, while ignoring the risk premium for jump-timing uncertainty by supposing $\\lambda^{*}=\\lambda$ : With this assumption, all jump risk premia will be artificially absorbed by the jump-size risk premium coefficient $\\mu-\\mu^{*}$ : The time- $t$ expected excess stock return compensating for the jump-size uncertainty is $\\lambda V_{t}(\\mu-\\mu^{*})$ :",

For example, the linear form of the volatility-risk premia $\\eta^{\\upsilon}V_{t}$ could be relaxed by introducing the polynomial form $\\eta_{0}+\\eta_{1}V_{t}+\\eta_{2}V_{t}^{2}+\\cdots+\\eta_{l}V_{t}^{l}$; for some constant coefficients $\\eta_{0},\\eta_{1},\\eta_{2},...,\\eta_{l}$: Our specification rules out the possibility that $\\eta_{0}\\neq0$; because it could imply nondiminishing risk premia as the volatility approaches to zero.

Any loss of efficiency as a result of this approach is expected to be small, because the particular stochastic natures of $r$ and $q$ play a relatively minor role in pricing the short-dated options.\n\n<!-- Page:8 -->\n\nestimation of the true model parameter $\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}_{0}$ ; which is assumed to live in a compact parameter space $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$ :\n\nGiven that options are non-linear functions of the state variables, the joint dynamics of the market observables $S_{n}$ and $C_{n}$ could be complicated, irrespective of the analytical tractability of the state variables $(S,V)$ . In order to take advantage of the analytical tractability of the state variables, we propose an \u2018\u2018implied-state\u2019\u2019 generalized method of moments (IS-GMM) approach. The basic idea of our approach is to take advantage of the option-pricing relation $C_{n}=$ $S_{n}f(V_{n},\\mathcal{H}_{0})$ by inverting, for a given set of model parameters W; a proxy $V_{n}^{9}$ for the unobserved volatility $V_{n}$ through $C_{n}=S_{n}f(V_{n}^{\\vartheta},\\vartheta)$ : Using $V_{n}^{\\vartheta}$ ; we can focus directly on the dynamic structure of the state variables $(S,V)$ . In our setting, the affine structure of $(\\ln S,V)$ allows us to calculate the joint conditional momentgenerating function of stock returns and volatility in closed-form, which, in turn, yields a rich set of moment conditions. Replacing $V_{n}$ by $V_{n}^{9}$ in the moment conditions, we can perform the usual GMM estimation, the only difference being that one of the state variables $V^{\\vartheta}$ is parameter-dependent, hence the term \u2018\u2018impliedstate\u2019\u2019 GMM.\n\nIn the remainder of this section, we will first provide a detailed description of the IS-GMM estimators and then discuss the selection of the optimal moment conditions. The large sample properties of the IS-GMM estimators are established in Appendix C. A recursive formula for calculating the joint conditional moments of return and volatility is given in Appendix D.\n\n### 3.1. \u2018\u2018Implied-state\u2019\u2019 GMM estimators\n\nFixing some time interval $\\varDelta$ ; we sample the continuous-time state process $\\{S_{t},~V_{t},~r_{t},~q_{t}\\}$ at discrete times $\\{0,\\varDelta,2\\varDelta,...,N A\\}$ and denote the sampled process $\\{S_{n\\underline{{{A}}}},~V_{n\\underline{{{A}}}},~r_{n\\underline{{{A}}}},~q_{n\\underline{{{A}}}}\\}$ by $\\{S_{n},~V_{n},~r_{n},~Q_{n}\\}$ : Letting\n\n$$\ny_n = \\ln S_n - \\ln S_{n-1} - \\int_{(n-1)\\Delta}^{n\\Delta} (r_u - q_u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u \\tag{3.1}\n$$\n\ndenote the date- $\\cdot n$ \u2018\u2018excess\u2019\u2019 return,10 it is easy to see that the transition distribution of $\\{y_{n},~V_{n}\\}$ depends only on the parameter vector W; and not on $\\theta_{r}$ or $\\theta_{q}$ : Suppose, for the moment, that both the stock return $y_{n}$ and volatility $V_{n}$ can be observed. Our estimation problem then falls into a standard GMM setting. Specifically, we can select $n_{h}$ moment conditions such that\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}_{n-1}^{\\theta_{0}}\\left[h\\left(y(n, n_{y}),\\ V(n, n_{v}),\\ \\theta_{0}\\right)\\right] = 0, \\tag{3.2}\n$$"

Replacing $V_{n}$ by $V_{n}^{9}$ in the moment conditions, we can perform the usual GMM estimation, the only difference being that one of the state variables $V^{\\vartheta}$ is parameter-dependent, hence the term \u2018\u2018impliedstate\u2019\u2019 GMM.\n\nIn the remainder of this section, we will first provide a detailed description of the IS-GMM estimators and then discuss the selection of the optimal moment conditions. The large sample properties of the IS-GMM estimators are established in Appendix C. A recursive formula for calculating the joint conditional moments of return and volatility is given in Appendix D.\n\n### 3.1. \u2018\u2018Implied-state\u2019\u2019 GMM estimators\n\nFixing some time interval $\\varDelta$ ; we sample the continuous-time state process $\\{S_{t},~V_{t},~r_{t},~q_{t}\\}$ at discrete times $\\{0,\\varDelta,2\\varDelta,...,N A\\}$ and denote the sampled process $\\{S_{n\\underline{{{A}}}},~V_{n\\underline{{{A}}}},~r_{n\\underline{{{A}}}},~q_{n\\underline{{{A}}}}\\}$ by $\\{S_{n},~V_{n},~r_{n},~Q_{n}\\}$ : Letting\n\n$$\ny_n = \\ln S_n - \\ln S_{n-1} - \\int_{(n-1)\\Delta}^{n\\Delta} (r_u - q_u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u \\tag{3.1}\n$$\n\ndenote the date- $\\cdot n$ \u2018\u2018excess\u2019\u2019 return,10 it is easy to see that the transition distribution of $\\{y_{n},~V_{n}\\}$ depends only on the parameter vector W; and not on $\\theta_{r}$ or $\\theta_{q}$ : Suppose, for the moment, that both the stock return $y_{n}$ and volatility $V_{n}$ can be observed. Our estimation problem then falls into a standard GMM setting. Specifically, we can select $n_{h}$ moment conditions such that\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}_{n-1}^{\\theta_{0}}\\left[h\\left(y(n, n_{y}),\\ V(n, n_{v}),\\ \\theta_{0}\\right)\\right] = 0, \\tag{3.2}\n$$"
