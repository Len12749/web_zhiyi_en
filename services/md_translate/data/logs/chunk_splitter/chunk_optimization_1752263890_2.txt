Not all Wednesdays are included, owing to data collection problems at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange during February 1985, November 1985, and September 1988.[^1]\n\nOther data needed in pricing foreign currency options include the underlying asset price, a risk-free discount rate, and the domestic/foreign interest rate differential. Transaction prices for IMM foreign currency futures were obtained from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the nearest preceding futures price of comparable or shorter maturity was used as the underlying asset price--provided the lapsed time was less than 5 minutes. Otherwise the option record was discarded. The futures data appeared of higher quality than the Telerate time-stamped spot exchange rate quotes provided by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Daily 3-month Treasury bill yields were used for the risk-free discount rate. The daily domestic/foreign interest rate differential was inferred and interpolated from synchronously recorded spot rates and 1- and 3-month forward rates, using covered interest parity and adjusting for weekend and end-of-month effects on the maturity of the forward contract.[^2]\n\n### 2.2 Unconstrained implicit parameter estimation methodology\n\nImplicit parameters were initially estimated on the panel data set of call and put prices for all observed strike prices and at most two quarterly maturities on Wednesday mornings over the period January 4, 1984, to June 19, 1991. The option pricing residual was defined as\n\n$$\ne_{i,t} \\equiv \\left(\\frac{O}{S}\\right)_{i,t} - O\\left(1, V_t, T_{i,t}; \\left(\\frac{X}{S}\\right)_{i,t}, \\theta\\right) \\tag{22}\n$$\n\nwhere t is an index over 372 Wednesday mornings within the specified period; i is an index over transactions (calls and puts of assorted strike prices and at most two quarterly maturities) on a given Wednesday morning; $(O/S)_{i,t}$ is the observed call or put option price/spot price ratio for a given transaction, using an implicit spot from a synchronous futures transaction; and $O(\\cdot)$ is the theoretical American option price/spot price ratio given the contractual terms of the option (call/put, time to maturity $T_{i,t}$, strike price/spot price ratio $(X/S)_{i,t})$ and given Wednesday morning's instantaneous variance V, interest\n\n---\n\n15 An oddity of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange database is that prior to September 28, 1984, every record appears twice.The duplicatedatawere discarded. 16 I am indebted to Sandy Grossman for providing the interest and exchange rate data.\n\n<!-- Page:12 -->\n\nrate $r_{t}$ and interest differential $b_{t}=r_{t}-r_{t}^{*}$, and the time-invariant parameters $\\theta$ of the model.\n\nFor the full stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model, $\\theta$ was the set of jump and stochastic volatility parameters: $\\theta=\\langle\\lambda^{*},\\bar{k}^{*},\\delta,\\alpha,\\beta^{*},\\sigma_{\\upsilon},\\rho\\rangle$\n\nThe following subcases of the general model were also estimated, in order to see which features of the generalized model were important in explaining option pricing deviations from benchmark Black-Scholes prices:\n\n1. Black-Scholes model (Bs), American option version, with the same implicit volatility for all maturities on a given day; estimated parameters: $\\{V_{t}\\}$\n2. Deterministic volatility model (DV), allowing daily a downward or upward sloping term structure of implicit volatilities (depending on whether $V_{t}\\gtrsim\\alpha/\\beta^{*})$; estimated parameters: $\\{V_{t}\\},\\alpha,\\beta^{*}$\n3. Deterministic volatility/jump-diffusion model (DvJD), allowing implicit skewness and excess kurtosis inversely related to option maturity; estimated parameters: $\\{V_{t}\\},\\lambda^{*},\\bar{k}^{*},\\delta,\\alpha,\\check{\\beta}^{*}$\n4. Stochastic volatility model (SV), allowing skewness and excess kurtosis directly related to option maturity; estimated parameters: $\\{V_{t}\\},\\alpha,\\beta^{*},\\sigma_{\\upsilon},\\rho$\n5. Stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model (SVJD), allowing mixed maturity effects on skewness and excess kurtosis; estimated parameters: $\\{\\dot{V_{t}}\\},\\lambda^{*},\\bar{k}^{*},\\delta,\\alpha,\\beta^{*},\\sigma_{\\nu},\\rho$\n\nNote that the average Wednesday morning realizations of the instantaneous conditional variance $\\{V_{t}\\}$ must also be estimated. Intradaily movements in spot variance were ignored in the estimation procedure.\n\nThe first three models are inherently ad hoc, in that the restriction that the estimated realizations $\\{V_{t}\\}$ be drawn from the postulated (degenerate) distribution has not been imposed and is obviously violated. Nonzero parameter estimates are being generated cross-sectionally off the observed moneyness and maturity biases of the option prices relative to Black-Scholes, and not off the time series properties of $\\{V_{t}\\}$ The separate case in which $V_{t}$ estimates are constrained by the postulated diffusion will be examined below.",
"text_b": "Central to estimating implicit parameters is identifying why hypothesized and observed options transactions prices deviate. Bid-ask bounce in transactions with the market specialist suggests that residuals are independent to a first approximation, with moneyness- and maturity-related heteroskedasticity. Imperfect synchronization with the appropriate underlying futures prices equally suggests independent, heteroskedastic residuals. The pooling error introduced by using a common spot variance for all transactions on a given Wednesday morning introduces more complex intradaily serial and cross-correla\n\n<!-- Page:13 -->\n\ntions in residuals that are beyond the scope of this article. A major issue for implicit parameter estimation is, however, specification error. Any parsimonious time series model imposes a structure on option prices that can capture only some of the features of the true data-generating process. Specification error implies that option pricing residuals of comparable moneyness and maturity will be contemporaneously correlated, and serially correlated as well if the conditional risk-neutral distribution evolves gradually over time in fashions not captured by the model. Furthermore, no-arbitrage constraints on option prices imply contemporaneous correlations across residuals of different strike prices and maturities. For instance, put-call parity for the European component of American option prices implies positively correlated residuals between calls and puts of identical moneyness and maturity in the presence of specification error. Consequently, implicit parameter estimation via nonlinear ordinary least squares (NLOLS) would yield misleadingly low estimated standard errors. A further problem when transactions data are used is that NL-OLS places too much weight on the substantially redundant information provided by heavily traded near-the-money options and virtually ignores the less actively traded in- and out-of-the-money options.$^{17}$\n\nConsequently, implicit parameters were estimated using a nonlinear generalized least squares (NL-GLS) methodology modeled on Engle and Mustafa (1992) that takes into account the heteroskedasticity, contemporaneous correlation, and serial correlation properties of option residuals. The residuals were sorted by call/put, maturity, and moneyness criteria into 40 groups,$^{18}$ and were assumed to include both group-specific and idiosyncratic shocks:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} \ne_{i,t} = \\epsilon_{I,t} + \\sigma_I \\eta_{i,t} \\quad \\text{for } i \\in G_I \\\\ \n\\epsilon_{I,t} = \\rho_I \\epsilon_{I,t-1} + \\nu_{I,t} \n\\end{array} \\right. \\tag{23}\n$$\n\nwhere $I$ is an index across the set of groups $\\{G_{I}\\};~\\nu_{I,t}$ is a mean-zero, normally distributed shock term common to all option prices in group $I$ at time $t$, with $E_{t-1}\\nu_{I,t}\\nu_{I,t}' = \\Sigma$ for positive semidefinite $\\Sigma$; and $\\eta_{i,t} \\sim N(0, 1)$ is an idiosyncratic shock to transaction $i$ at time $t$.\n\n---\n\n17 An earlier version of this article that used NL-OLS estimation appeared in December 1993 as NBER working paper no. 4596, under the same title. Estimates in that article differed substantially from those presented below, in two areas. First, the heavy weight on near-the-money options resulted in implicit jump parameter estimates that were statistically but not economically significant, and had little relevance for the volatility smile. Second, parameter estimation using options and time series data effectively gave extremely heavy weight to fitting the options, and downweighted time series plausibility.\n\n18 The criteria were (1) whether the transaction involved a call or a put; (2) whether the quarterly maturity was short-term (roughly 0 to 3 months) or medium-term (3 to 6 months); and (3) which of 10 alternatives characterized the strike price/futures price ratio: < 0.94, [0.94, 0.96), [0.96, 0.98), [0.98, 0.99), [0.99, 1), [1, 1.01), [1.01, 1.02), [1.02, 1.04), [1.04, 1.06), or \u2265 1.06.\n\n<!-- Page:14 -->\n\nuncorrelated with v1. t.

Since there can be up to 400 transactions per Wednesday morning, computational efficiency is substantially increased by using an orthogonalizing transformation for day- and group-specific residuals:\n\n$$\n\\bar{e}_{l,t} \\equiv \\frac{1}{N_{l,t}} \\sum_{t=1}^{N_{l,t}} e_{i,t} \\quad \\text{for} \\ e_{i,t} \\in G_I \\tag{25}\\\\ u_{i,t} \\equiv e_{i,t} - \\bar{e}_{l,t}, \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, N_{l,t} - 1,\n$$\n\nwhere NI,t is the number of transactions in group I on date t.

First and second derivatives of the loss function were computed numerically, coded to eliminate irrelevant computations.$^{22}$ Estimates of implicit parameters on the full data set generally took 3 to 5 days on a dedicated Hewlett-Packard Apollo 735 workstation, depending upon which model was used.\n\n### 2.3 Results\n\nSeveral interesting features emerge from the estimates of the stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model and assorted submodels shown in Table 2. The deterministic volatility (DV) model's relaxation of the Black-Scholes assumption of a flat term structure of implicit volatilities substantially improved the fit of O- to 3-month near-the-money call and put options, by up to 0.015 percent of the underlying spot exchange rate (roughly one price tick). The fit for 3- to 6-month calls tended to worsen, by up to 0.005 percent, while mixed effects were observed for $3\\cdot$ to 6-month puts. The tendency for the term structure of implicit volatilities to be upward (downward) sloping for low (high) short-term implicit volatilities was qualitatively consistent with the postulated volatility mean reversion. NL-GLS estimates of the halflife of volatility shocks based essentially on the average slope of the term structure of implicit volatilities ranged from 6.4 to 10.6 months, depending on whether jumps were not or were included.\n\nAllowing for skewed and/or leptokurtic distributions via the deterministic volatility/jump-diffusion (DVJD), stochastic volatility (SV),\n\n<!-- Page:16 -->\n\n<center><i>Table 2 Implicit parameter estimates for various models </i></center>\n\n| Model | Jump parameters |  |  |  | Stochastic volatility parameters |  |  |  | $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta^*}}$ | half-life |  | $\\ln L_{\\text{options}}$ |\n|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|\n|  | $\\lambda^*$ | $\\bar{k}^*$ | $\\delta$ | $\\sqrt{V_{\\text{jump}}}$ | $\\alpha$ | $\\beta^*$ | $\\sigma_v$ | $\\rho$ | (months) |  |\n| BS | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |  | 120,345.89 |\n| DV | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | .020 | 1.20 | 0 | 0 | .130 | 6.9 | 120,396.54 |\n|  |  |  |  |  | (.001) | (.001) |  |  | (.002) | (.1) |  |\n| DVJD | .76 | .006 | .077 | .067 | .007 | .98 | 0 | 0 | .085 | 8.4 | 120,583.16 |\n|  | (.01) | (.000) | (.001) |  | (.001) | (.00) |  |  | (.003) | (.0) |  |\n| SV | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | .031 | 1.30 | .284 | .045 | .155 | 6.4 | 120,644.45 |\n|  |  |  |  |  | (.001) | (.01) | (.005) | (.002) | (.002) | (.1) |  |\n| SVJD | 15.01 | -0.001 | .019 | .072 | .019 | .78 | .343 | .078 | .144 | 10.6 | 120,699.27 |\n|  | (1.21) | (.000) | (.001) |  | (.001) | (.02) | (.008) | (.003) | (.003) | (.1) |  |\n\n<center>\n<div style=\"display: inline-block; text-align: left; max-width: 80%;\">\n<i>Nonlinear generalized least squares estimates of the risk-neutral implicit stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion process </i>\n</div>\n</center>\n\n$$\n\\begin{align} \ndS/S &= (b - \\lambda^* k^*) dt + \\sqrt{V} dZ^* + k^* dq^* \\\\ \ndV &= (\\alpha - \\beta^* V) dt + \\sigma_v \\sqrt{V} dZ_v^* \\\\ \n\\text{cov}(dZ^*, dZ_v^*) &= \\rho dt \n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{prob}(dq^* = 1) = \\lambda^* dt, \\ln(1 + k^*) \\sim N(\\ln(1 + \\bar{k}^*) - \\frac{1}{2} \\delta^2, \\delta^2)\n$$"

Not all Wednesdays are included, owing to data collection problems at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange during February 1985, November 1985, and September 1988.[^1]\n\nOther data needed in pricing foreign currency options include the underlying asset price, a risk-free discount rate, and the domestic/foreign interest rate differential. Transaction prices for IMM foreign currency futures were obtained from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the nearest preceding futures price of comparable or shorter maturity was used as the underlying asset price--provided the lapsed time was less than 5 minutes. Otherwise the option record was discarded. The futures data appeared of higher quality than the Telerate time-stamped spot exchange rate quotes provided by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Daily 3-month Treasury bill yields were used for the risk-free discount rate. The daily domestic/foreign interest rate differential was inferred and interpolated from synchronously recorded spot rates and 1- and 3-month forward rates, using covered interest parity and adjusting for weekend and end-of-month effects on the maturity of the forward contract.[^2]\n\n### 2.2 Unconstrained implicit parameter estimation methodology\n\nImplicit parameters were initially estimated on the panel data set of call and put prices for all observed strike prices and at most two quarterly maturities on Wednesday mornings over the period January 4, 1984, to June 19, 1991. The option pricing residual was defined as\n\n$$\ne_{i,t} \\equiv \\left(\\frac{O}{S}\\right)_{i,t} - O\\left(1, V_t, T_{i,t}; \\left(\\frac{X}{S}\\right)_{i,t}, \\theta\\right) \\tag{22}\n$$\n\nwhere t is an index over 372 Wednesday mornings within the specified period; i is an index over transactions (calls and puts of assorted strike prices and at most two quarterly maturities) on a given Wednesday morning; $(O/S)_{i,t}$ is the observed call or put option price/spot price ratio for a given transaction, using an implicit spot from a synchronous futures transaction; and $O(\\cdot)$ is the theoretical American option price/spot price ratio given the contractual terms of the option (call/put, time to maturity $T_{i,t}$, strike price/spot price ratio $(X/S)_{i,t})$ and given Wednesday morning's instantaneous variance V, interest rate $r_{t}$ and interest differential $b_{t}=r_{t}-r_{t}^{*}$, and the time-invariant parameters $\\theta$ of the model.\n\nFor the full stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model, $\\theta$ was the set of jump and stochastic volatility parameters: $\\theta=\\langle\\lambda^{*},\\bar{k}^{*},\\delta,\\alpha,\\beta^{*},\\sigma_{\\upsilon},\\rho\\rangle$\n\nThe following subcases of the general model were also estimated, in order to see which features of the generalized model were important in explaining option pricing deviations from benchmark Black-Scholes prices:\n\n1. Black-Scholes model (Bs), American option version, with the same implicit volatility for all maturities on a given day; estimated parameters: $\\{V_{t}\\}$\n2. Deterministic volatility model (DV), allowing daily a downward or upward sloping term structure of implicit volatilities (depending on whether $V_{t}\\gtrsim\\alpha/\\beta^{*})$; estimated parameters: $\\{V_{t}\\},\\alpha,\\beta^{*}$\n3. Deterministic volatility/jump-diffusion model (DvJD), allowing implicit skewness and excess kurtosis inversely related to option maturity; estimated parameters: $\\{V_{t}\\},\\lambda^{*},\\bar{k}^{*},\\delta,\\alpha,\\check{\\beta}^{*}$\n4. Stochastic volatility model (SV), allowing skewness and excess kurtosis directly related to option maturity; estimated parameters: $\\{V_{t}\\},\\alpha,\\beta^{*},\\sigma_{\\upsilon},\\rho$\n5. Stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model (SVJD), allowing mixed maturity effects on skewness and excess kurtosis; estimated parameters: $\\{\\dot{V_{t}}\\},\\lambda^{*},\\bar{k}^{*},\\delta,\\alpha,\\beta^{*},\\sigma_{\\nu},\\rho$\n\nNote that the average Wednesday morning realizations of the instantaneous conditional variance $\\{V_{t}\\}$ must also be estimated. Intradaily movements in spot variance were ignored in the estimation procedure.\n\nThe first three models are inherently ad hoc, in that the restriction that the estimated realizations $\\{V_{t}\\}$ be drawn from the postulated (degenerate) distribution has not been imposed and is obviously violated. Nonzero parameter estimates are being generated cross-sectionally off the observed moneyness and maturity biases of the option prices relative to Black-Scholes, and not off the time series properties of $\\{V_{t}\\}$ The separate case in which $V_{t}$ estimates are constrained by the postulated diffusion will be examined below.\n\n---\n\n15 An oddity of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange database is that prior to September 28, 1984, every record appears twice.The duplicatedatawere discarded. 16 I am indebted to Sandy Grossman for providing the interest and exchange rate data.",
"text_b": "<!-- Page:12 -->\n\nCentral to estimating implicit parameters is identifying why hypothesized and observed options transactions prices deviate. Bid-ask bounce in transactions with the market specialist suggests that residuals are independent to a first approximation, with moneyness- and maturity-related heteroskedasticity. Imperfect synchronization with the appropriate underlying futures prices equally suggests independent, heteroskedastic residuals. The pooling error introduced by using a common spot variance for all transactions on a given Wednesday morning introduces more complex intradaily serial and cross-correla\n\n<!-- Page:13 -->\n\ntions in residuals that are beyond the scope of this article. A major issue for implicit parameter estimation is, however, specification error. Any parsimonious time series model imposes a structure on option prices that can capture only some of the features of the true data-generating process. Specification error implies that option pricing residuals of comparable moneyness and maturity will be contemporaneously correlated, and serially correlated as well if the conditional risk-neutral distribution evolves gradually over time in fashions not captured by the model. Furthermore, no-arbitrage constraints on option prices imply contemporaneous correlations across residuals of different strike prices and maturities. For instance, put-call parity for the European component of American option prices implies positively correlated residuals between calls and puts of identical moneyness and maturity in the presence of specification error. Consequently, implicit parameter estimation via nonlinear ordinary least squares (NLOLS) would yield misleadingly low estimated standard errors. A further problem when transactions data are used is that NL-OLS places too much weight on the substantially redundant information provided by heavily traded near-the-money options and virtually ignores the less actively traded in- and out-of-the-money options.$^{17}$\n\nConsequently, implicit parameters were estimated using a nonlinear generalized least squares (NL-GLS) methodology modeled on Engle and Mustafa (1992) that takes into account the heteroskedasticity, contemporaneous correlation, and serial correlation properties of option residuals. The residuals were sorted by call/put, maturity, and moneyness criteria into 40 groups,$^{18}$ and were assumed to include both group-specific and idiosyncratic shocks:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} \ne_{i,t} = \\epsilon_{I,t} + \\sigma_I \\eta_{i,t} \\quad \\text{for } i \\in G_I \\\\ \n\\epsilon_{I,t} = \\rho_I \\epsilon_{I,t-1} + \\nu_{I,t} \n\\end{array} \\right. \\tag{23}\n$$\n\nwhere $I$ is an index across the set of groups $\\{G_{I}\\};~\\nu_{I,t}$ is a mean-zero, normally distributed shock term common to all option prices in group $I$ at time $t$, with $E_{t-1}\\nu_{I,t}\\nu_{I,t}' = \\Sigma$ for positive semidefinite $\\Sigma$; and $\\eta_{i,t} \\sim N(0, 1)$ is an idiosyncratic shock to transaction $i$ at time $t$.\n\n---\n\n17 An earlier version of this article that used NL-OLS estimation appeared in December 1993 as NBER working paper no. 4596, under the same title. Estimates in that article differed substantially from those presented below, in two areas. First, the heavy weight on near-the-money options resulted in implicit jump parameter estimates that were statistically but not economically significant, and had little relevance for the volatility smile. Second, parameter estimation using options and time series data effectively gave extremely heavy weight to fitting the options, and downweighted time series plausibility.\n\n18 The criteria were (1) whether the transaction involved a call or a put; (2) whether the quarterly maturity was short-term (roughly 0 to 3 months) or medium-term (3 to 6 months); and (3) which of 10 alternatives characterized the strike price/futures price ratio: < 0.94, [0.94, 0.96), [0.96, 0.98), [0.98, 0.99), [0.99, 1), [1, 1.01), [1.01, 1.02), [1.02, 1.04), [1.04, 1.06), or \u2265 1.06.\n\n<!-- Page:14 -->\n\nuncorrelated with v1. t.

First and second derivatives of the loss function were computed numerically, coded to eliminate irrelevant computations.$^{22}$ Estimates of implicit parameters on the full data set generally took 3 to 5 days on a dedicated Hewlett-Packard Apollo 735 workstation, depending upon which model was used.\n\n### 2.3 Results\n\nSeveral interesting features emerge from the estimates of the stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model and assorted submodels shown in Table 2. The deterministic volatility (DV) model's relaxation of the Black-Scholes assumption of a flat term structure of implicit volatilities substantially improved the fit of O- to 3-month near-the-money call and put options, by up to 0.015 percent of the underlying spot exchange rate (roughly one price tick). The fit for 3- to 6-month calls tended to worsen, by up to 0.005 percent, while mixed effects were observed for $3\\cdot$ to 6-month puts. The tendency for the term structure of implicit volatilities to be upward (downward) sloping for low (high) short-term implicit volatilities was qualitatively consistent with the postulated volatility mean reversion. NL-GLS estimates of the halflife of volatility shocks based essentially on the average slope of the term structure of implicit volatilities ranged from 6.4 to 10.6 months, depending on whether jumps were not or were included.\n\nAllowing for skewed and/or leptokurtic distributions via the deterministic volatility/jump-diffusion (DVJD), stochastic volatility (SV),\n\n<!-- Page:16 -->\n\n<center><i>Table 2 Implicit parameter estimates for various models </i></center>\n\n| Model | Jump parameters |  |  |  | Stochastic volatility parameters |  |  |  | $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta^*}}$ | half-life |  | $\\ln L_{\\text{options}}$ |\n|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|\n|  | $\\lambda^*$ | $\\bar{k}^*$ | $\\delta$ | $\\sqrt{V_{\\text{jump}}}$ | $\\alpha$ | $\\beta^*$ | $\\sigma_v$ | $\\rho$ | (months) |  |\n| BS | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |  | 120,345.89 |\n| DV | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | .020 | 1.20 | 0 | 0 | .130 | 6.9 | 120,396.54 |\n|  |  |  |  |  | (.001) | (.001) |  |  | (.002) | (.1) |  |\n| DVJD | .76 | .006 | .077 | .067 | .007 | .98 | 0 | 0 | .085 | 8.4 | 120,583.16 |\n|  | (.01) | (.000) | (.001) |  | (.001) | (.00) |  |  | (.003) | (.0) |  |\n| SV | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | .031 | 1.30 | .284 | .045 | .155 | 6.4 | 120,644.45 |\n|  |  |  |  |  | (.001) | (.01) | (.005) | (.002) | (.002) | (.1) |  |\n| SVJD | 15.01 | -0.001 | .019 | .072 | .019 | .78 | .343 | .078 | .144 | 10.6 | 120,699.27 |\n|  | (1.21) | (.000) | (.001) |  | (.001) | (.02) | (.008) | (.003) | (.003) | (.1) |  |\n\n<center>\n<div style=\"display: inline-block; text-align: left; max-width: 80%;\">\n<i>Nonlinear generalized least squares estimates of the risk-neutral implicit stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion process </i>\n</div>\n</center>\n\n$$\n\\begin{align} \ndS/S &= (b - \\lambda^* k^*) dt + \\sqrt{V} dZ^* + k^* dq^* \\\\ \ndV &= (\\alpha - \\beta^* V) dt + \\sigma_v \\sqrt{V} dZ_v^* \\\\ \n\\text{cov}(dZ^*, dZ_v^*) &= \\rho dt \n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{prob}(dq^* = 1) = \\lambda^* dt, \\ln(1 + k^*) \\sim N(\\ln(1 + \\bar{k}^*) - \\frac{1}{2} \\delta^2, \\delta^2)\n$$"
