This implies that, when weighted by aversion to large price movements, negative jumps are perceived to be more negative.

It seems, however, that fear of such adverse price movements is reflected in option prices, through a large jump-risk premium.20\n\nA revisit to the goodness-of-fit test associated with $\\operatorname{E}(\\varepsilon_{n}^{y2})$ reveals that it is no longer strongly violated for either the SV model or the SVJ0 model, suggesting that allowing for risk premia does reconcile, to some extent, the tension between the spot and option prices that arises in the SV0 model.

The spot-market volatility is about $11\\%$ for this day, while the Black\u2013Scholes implied-vol for the one-month contract is around $13\\%$ . Consistent with our earlier discussion, there is a gap between the volatility measured directly from the spot market and that implied by option prices (through either the Black\u2013Scholes model or the SV0 model, which have essentially the same riskpremium structure). Both the SVJ0 and SV models are able to explain this gap \u2013 one by jump-risk premia and the other by volatility-risk premia. But their respective projections on the long-dated options are very different. In particular, for the SV model to explain the risk premia implicit in the one-month options, it requires a volatility-risk premium coefficient $\\eta^{v}$ of such high magnitude that the estimated riskneutral mean-reversion rate $\\hat{\\kappa}_{v}^{*}=\\hat{\\kappa}_{v}-\\eta^{v}$ is negative, implying an explosive riskneutral volatility process. Although this is not explicitly precluded by arbitrage arguments, it does cause the SV model to severely overprice long-dated options, as illustrated in Fig. 3.

In fact, it can be shown that as the maturity of an option approaches zero, the effect of volatilityrisk premia diminishes, while that for jump-risk premia does not. It is closely related to the fact that volatility risk influences stock prices through (diffusive) Brownian motions.\n\n<!-- Page:19 -->\n\nFig. 4 illustrates another important difference between the two types of risk premia considered in this paper. For short-dated options, the jump-risk premia respond quickly to market volatility, while the volatility-risk premia do not. For instance, Fig. 4 shows that when the market volatility doubles from $10\\%$ to $20\\%$ , the percentage premium paid for jump risk nearly doubles, while that for volatility risk increases only by a small amount. This different responsiveness to the market volatility implies that volatility-risk premia under-estimate the risk premia implicit in short-dated options during high-volatility periods, while over-estimating during lowvolatility periods. This partially explains why the SV model is strongly rejected by the joint time-series data.",

In fact, in our first attempt to estimate jump-risk premia (not reported here), we adopt the specification of constant jump arrival intensity. For the purpose of reconciling the joint time-series data, this specification is problematic because it assigns the same amount of jump-risk premia irrespective of the market volatility. In such a setting, on days of high volatility, when options become more expensive, the percentage jump-risk premia effectively decreases. This partially explains the findings of Eraker (2000), who adopts the specification of constant jumparrival intensity, and concludes jump-risk premia to be insignificant under this setting.\n\n### 5.2. Simultaneous estimation of jump- and volatility-risk premia\n\nIn this section, we focus on a simultaneous estimation of the premia for jump and volatility risks, evaluating the relative magnitude of the two types of risk premia. For this, we focus on the SVJ model, which relaxes the constraint $\\eta^{v}=0$ from the SVJ0 model.\n\nA direct estimation of the SVJ model using the joint time-series data $\\{S_{n},~C_{n}\\}$ reveals that our ability to pin down the relative magnitude of volatility-risk and jumprisk premia is limited.[^2] Using the intuition that OTM/ITM options might have different sensitivities to the volatility and jump risks, we introduce an additional time series $\\{C_{n}^{\\mathrm{ITM}}\\}$ of ITM calls (see data collection details in Section 4.2) in our model estimation. We assume that such ITM calls are priced with errors, and that the pricing errors are independent across time, and independent of the three sources of uncertainty in the SVJ model. Moreover, we assume that on each date $n$ , the standard deviation of the date $\\cdot n$ pricing error is proportional to the bid/ask spread.[^3]\n\n---\n\n[^1]: It should be noted that this test result does not imply that the constant component $\\lambda_{0}$ of the jump arrival intensity is not important in capturing the jump behavior in the index dynamics. In fact, using longer time-series data with daily frequency, Chernov et al. (1999) report evidence in support of such a constant component. Johannes et al. (1998), on the other hand, provide evidence in support of the state-dependent component in jump arrival intensity. Given the relatively short sample and weekly frequency used in this paper, our ability to pin down the jump component in the index dynamics is very limited. (For example, the estimate for $\\mu$ is not significant.) The key point one would want to take away from this result is that in terms of reconciling spot and option dynamics, the state-dependent component $\\lambda$ plays a far more important role than the constant component $\\lambda_{0}$\n\n[^2]: The estnreults tmdearet rrt arevalanrqt\n\n[^3]: We choose ITM call instead of OTM puts because there are overwhelmingly more quotes on ITM calls than on OTM puts. Consequently, it is easier to construct a time series of ITM-call quotes with strike-to-spot ratio as close to 0.95 as possible.

Given that put-call parity holds relatively well, and that we scale the pricing error by the bid/ask spread, which should reflect liquidity, the choice between OTM puts and ITM calls is not expected to affect our results in any significant fashion.\n\n<!-- Page:21 -->\n\nthese assumptions, letting CITM and $k_{n}^{\\mathrm{ITM}}$ be the date $\\cdot n$ price-to-spot ratio and striketo-spot ratio, respectively, of the in-the-money call option, we form the moment condition\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}\\left(\\mathscr{H}_{n}^{\\mathrm{ITM}}\\right)=0 \\quad \\text { with } \\quad \\mathscr{H}_{n}^{\\mathrm{ITM}}=\\frac{c_{n}^{\\mathrm{ITM}}-f\\left(V_{n}, \\vartheta, r_{n}, q_{n}, \\tau_{n}, k_{n}^{\\mathrm{ITM}}\\right)}{\\delta_{n}^{\\mathrm{ITM}}} \\tag{5.1}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\delta_{n}^{\\mathrm{ITM}}$ is the date $\\cdot n$ bid-ask spread (per unit spot price) and $f$ is the SVJ option pricing formula defined in Eq.
