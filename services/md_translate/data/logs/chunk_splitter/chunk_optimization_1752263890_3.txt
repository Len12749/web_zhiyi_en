"text_a": "using data on 19,689 call and put prices with 0- to 3-month and 3- to 6-month quarterly maturities observed on 372 Wednesday mornings over January 14, 1984, to July 19, 1991. The 372 Wednesday morning realizations of the implicit spot variances were also estimated. All parameters in annualized units except the risk-neutral half-life $(12\\mid\\mathtt{n}2)/\\beta^{*}$ of volatility shocks, which is in months. Standard errors are in parentheses. $V_{jump}=\\lambda^{*}\\{[\\ln(1+\\bar{k}^{*})-\\frac{1}{2}\\delta^{2}]^{2}+\\delta^{2}\\}$ is the instantaneous conditional variance per year attributable to jumps in the risk-neutral distribution. $(\\alpha/\\beta^{*})$ is the steady-state level per year towards which stochastic variance $\\mathbf{V}_{t}$ tends to revert.\n\n<!-- Page:17 -->\n\nJumps and Stocbastic Volatility: Exchange Rate Processes Implicit in Deutscbe Mark Options and stochastic volatility-jump-diffusion (SVJD) specifications further improved the models' ability to fit option prices. The major impact was on in- and out-of-the-money 0- to 3-month call and put options, the fit for which improved by up to 0.015 percent. Slightly positive implicit skewess was estimated for all three models: positive correlation between exchange rate and volatility shocks and/or positivemean jumps. Similarly, parameter estimates from all models (substantial jump components and/or substantially volatile volatility) implied substantial implicit excess kurtosis. Based on the relative fits of the nonnested DVJD and SV models, the variation of higher implicit moments across different maturities is better characterized by the direct relationship implied by stochastic volatility models than by the strong inverse relationship characteristic of jump models.[^1]\n\nThe estimated instantaneous conditional (or \u201cspot) variances $V_{j u m p}$ $+V_{t}$ were generally very close for all models, where $V_{j u m p}=\\lambda^{*}\\{\\lbrack\\mathrm{lin}(1\\dot{+}$ $\\bar{k}^{*})-{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}\\delta^{2}]^{2}+\\delta^{2}\\}$ is the (constant) variance per year atributable to jumps. However, the sample path for spot variance estimated under the SvJD model involved a reflection off the minimum value of $V_{j u m p}=(0.072)^{2}$ (see Figure 1), whereas the path estimated under the SV model never approached the reflecting barrier at $V_{t}=0$ More comparable to standard Black-Scholes implicit variances is the expected average variance\n\n$$\nE\\overline{V} = V_{jump} + w(T)V_t + [1 - w(T)]\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta^*} \\tag{27}\n$$\n\nfor $w(T)=(1-e^{-\\beta^{*}T})/\\beta^{*}T\\in\\left(0,1\\right)$ The expected average variance is a maturity-dependent weighted average of the spot variance $V_{j u m p}+V_{t}$ and the steady-state variance $V_{j u m p}+\\alpha/\\beta^{*}$ . Given estimated slow mean reversion, the estimated expected average variance for 0- to 6-month options was close to the spot variance and is consequently not shown.\n\nDespite the improved fit relative to Black-Scholes, the conditional standard errors of the stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model shown in Table 3 are still large. Freely parameterized option pricing models involving daily parameter reestimation typically yield substantially lower overall root mean squared error, on the order of 0.04 percent of the underlying asset price; examples include the constrained cubic spline and Merton (1976) jump-diffusion models in Bates (1991, 1994). While ad boc, such models do satisfy option-specific, no-arbitrage constraints and therefore generate theoretically valid option prices\n\n---\n\n[^1]: Bates (1994) finds that implicit excess kurtosis in DM and yen futures options tended to increase as option maturities decreased, but not as fast as predicted by Merton's (1976) jump-diffusion model.\n\n<!-- Page:18 -->\n\n<center><i>Figure 1 Instantaneous conditional (spot) volatility implicit in deutsche mark options, 1984-1991.

The implications are that specification error is large relative to other sources of error, and that the postulated model fails to capture major changes in implicit distributions over time.\n\nFurther evidence of parametric instability is revealed in implicit parameter estimates over two-year subsamples; see Table 4. The major problem is that the postulated one-factor model for expected average variances in Equation (27) fails to capture the evolution over time of the term structure of implicit volatilities across short-term (0 to 3 month) and medium-term (3 to 6 month) maturities. Whereas the term structure was essentially flat in 1984 to 1985, as indicated by a long half-life to volatility shocks, steeper term structures were observed in subsequent years. Evolutions in other moments were also observed; implicit distributions were substantially positively skewed over the period 1984 to 1987, but were essentially symmetric over the period 1988 to 1991. Substantial implicit excess kurtosis was present in all biannual subsamples.\n\nParameter instability explains the apparent puzzle in Table 3 that average pricing errors for short-term in-the-money calls and out-of-the-money puts diverge in sign, whereas put-call parity (for the European portion of the option prices) implies that the pricing errors should be comparable in sign and magnitude. The divergent average\n\n---\n\n88\n\n<!-- Page:19 -->\n\n<center><i>Table 3 Residuals from estimation of the stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model, categorized by cal/ put, moneyness, and maturity </i></center>\n\n| Moneyness $(X/F - 1)$ | Number of observations | Average errors | Conditional standard deviations | Contemp. | Lagged | Number of observations | Average errors | Conditional standard deviations | Contemp. | Lagged | Call/put |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Short-term (0\u20133 month) calls |  |  |  |  |  | Short-term (0\u20133 month) puts |  |  |  |  |  |\n| $< -6\\%$ | 646 | .027% | .048% | .57 | .58 | 92 | $-.002\\%$ | .135% | .80 | .07 | .07 |\n| $[-6\\%, -4\\%]$ | 1140 | .016% | .055% | .62 | .28 | 132 | $-.001\\%$ | .091% | .65 | .06 | .17 |\n| $[-4\\%, -2\\%]$ | 1051 | .011% | .070% | .64 | .20 | 151 | .023% | .110% | .63 | $-.43$ | .37 |\n| $[-2\\%, -1\\%]$ | 1151 | .011% | .076% | .70 | .10 | 283 | .003% | .090% | .61 | .09 | .37 |\n| $[-1\\%, 0\\%]$ | 1360 | .011% | .085% | .71 | .17 | 585 | .002% | .097% | .78 | .12 | .36 |\n| $[0\\%, 1\\%]$ | 1053 | .006% | .100% | .62 | $-.03$ | 920 | .034% | .093% | .75 | .07 | .46 |\n| $[1\\%, 2\\%]$ | 499 | $-.030\\%$ | .104% | .49 | .18 | 911 | .027% | .080% | .82 | .05 | .32 |\n| $[2\\%, 4\\%]$ | 334 | $-.003\\%$ | .114% | .46 | .18 | 788 | .022% | .072% | .88 | .09 | .30 |\n| $[4\\%, 6\\%]$ | 576 | $-.039\\%$ | .116% | .42 | .43 | 939 | .024% | .064% | .74 | .12 | .15 |\n| $> 6\\%$ | 534 | $-.070\\%$ | .115% | .42 | .42 | 828 | .033% | .047% | .67 | .20 | .01 |\n| Medium-term (3\u20136 month) calls |  |  |  |  |  | Medium-term (3\u20136 month) puts |  |  |  |  |  |\n| $< -6\\%$ | 492 | $-.027\\%$ | .076% | .68 | $-.25$ | 38 | $-.095\\%$ | .124% | .81 | .82 | .22 |\n| $[-6\\%, -4\\%]$ | 434 | $-.009\\%$ | .088% | .75 | .00 | 29 | $-.053\\%$ | .100% | .92 | $-.38$ | .46 |\n| $[-4\\%, -2\\%]$ | 333 | $-.009\\%$ | .083% | .57 | .07 | 41 | $-.097\\%$ | .115% | .85 | $-.04$ | .18 |\n| $[-2\\%, -1\\%]$ | 434 | .013% | .086% | .74 | .30 | 76 | $-.019\\%$ | .132% | .85 | $-.16$ | .22 |\n| $[-1\\%, 0\\%]$ | 476 | $-.001\\%$ | .094% | .70 | $-.05$ | 175 | $-.021\\%$ | .120% | .85 | $-.22$ | .07 |\n| $[0\\%, 1\\%]$ | 414 | $-.009\\%$ | .094% | .59 | .04 | 208 | $-.009\\%$ | .096% | .78 | .29 | .26 |\n| $[1\\%, 2\\%]$ | 322 | $-.015\\%$ | .116% | .59 | .07 | 271 | .001% | .095% | .64 | $-.04$ | .15 |\n| $[2\\%, 4\\%]$ | 190 | $-.046\\%$ | .125% | .73 | $-.27$ | 197 | .000% | .087% | .83 | .03 | .14 |\n| $[4\\%, 6\\%]$ | 237 | $-.062\\%$ | .125% | .56 | .06 | 410 | $-.011\\%$ | .066% | .58 | $-.11$ | .22 |\n| $> 6\\%$ | 276 | $-.125\\%$ | .160% | .60 | .36 | 663 | $-.003\\%$ | .050% | .69 | .16 | .09 |\n\nAverage errors (actual less estimated option prices) and standard deviations are expressed as a percentage of the underlying spot exchange rate.

Tests of Consistency with the Underlying Time Series\n\n### 3.1 Tests of consistency with the time series properties of implicit volatilities\n\nAs noted by Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985), the transition density of $y=2c V_{t+\\Delta t}$ conditional on $V_{t}$ is noncentral $\\chi^{2}(4\\alpha/\\sigma_{v}^{2},~2c V_{t}e^{-\\dot{\\beta}\\Delta t})$ where $c^{-\\mathrm{i}}\\equiv{\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\sigma_{v}^{2}(1-e^{-\\beta\\Delta t})/\\beta$ and $\\beta$ is the actual rate of mean reversion of the volatility process (as distinct from the risk-adjusted parameter $\\beta^{*}$ implicit in option prices):\n\n$$\np(y \\mid V_t) = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(y + \\Lambda)} y^{\\frac{1}{2}v - 1}}{2^{\\frac{1}{2}v}} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{4}y\\Lambda\\right)^j}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{2}v + j\\right) j!} \\tag{28}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\nu\\equiv4\\alpha/\\sigma_{\\nu}^{2}$ , $\\Lambda\\equiv2c V_{t}e^{-\\beta\\Delta t}$ , and $\\Gamma(\\cdot)$ is the gamma function. However, the noncentral $\\chi^{2}$ density function has infinite value at $2c V_{t+\\Delta t}=0$ when the reflecting barrier is attainable $\\begin{array}{r}{(\\frac{1}{2}\\nu<1)}\\end{array}$ , yielding nonsensical results when the sample path $\\{V_{t}\\}$ is among the parameters to be estimated. Consequently, the applications below use the transition density of the monotonic transformation $\\ln(V_{t+\\Delta t})$ , which has finite density everywhere:\n\n$$\np(\\ln V_{t+\\Delta t} \\mid V_t) = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(e^z + \\Lambda)} (e^z)^{\\frac{1}{2}v}}{2^{\\frac{1}{2}v}} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\frac{1}{4}e^z \\Lambda)^j}{\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2}v + j) j!} \\tag{29}\n$$\n\nwhere $e^{z}=2c V_{t+\\Delta t}$ .\n\nMaximum likelihood estimates of the parameters $\\{\\alpha,\\beta,\\sigma_{\\nu}\\}$ using the time series of implicit instantaneous conditional volatilities $\\{V_{t}\\}$ diverge substantially from the parameters $\\{\\alpha,\\beta^{*},\\sigma_{\\upsilon}\\}$ estimated crosssectionally from option prices, as is shown in Table 5 (sV and sVJD models).

The 372 Wednesday morning realizations of the implicit spot variances were also estimated. All parameters in annualized units except the risk-neutral half-life $(12\\mid\\mathtt{n}2)/\\beta^{*}$ of volatility shocks, which is in months. Standard errors are in parentheses. $V_{jump}=\\lambda^{*}\\{[\\ln(1+\\bar{k}^{*})-\\frac{1}{2}\\delta^{2}]^{2}+\\delta^{2}\\}$ is the instantaneous conditional variance per year attributable to jumps in the risk-neutral distribution. $(\\alpha/\\beta^{*})$ is the steady-state level per year towards which stochastic variance $\\mathbf{V}_{t}$ tends to revert.\n\n<!-- Page:17 -->\n\nJumps and Stocbastic Volatility: Exchange Rate Processes Implicit in Deutscbe Mark Options and stochastic volatility-jump-diffusion (SVJD) specifications further improved the models' ability to fit option prices. The major impact was on in- and out-of-the-money 0- to 3-month call and put options, the fit for which improved by up to 0.015 percent. Slightly positive implicit skewess was estimated for all three models: positive correlation between exchange rate and volatility shocks and/or positivemean jumps. Similarly, parameter estimates from all models (substantial jump components and/or substantially volatile volatility) implied substantial implicit excess kurtosis. Based on the relative fits of the nonnested DVJD and SV models, the variation of higher implicit moments across different maturities is better characterized by the direct relationship implied by stochastic volatility models than by the strong inverse relationship characteristic of jump models.[^1]\n\nThe estimated instantaneous conditional (or \u201cspot) variances $V_{j u m p}$ $+V_{t}$ were generally very close for all models, where $V_{j u m p}=\\lambda^{*}\\{\\lbrack\\mathrm{lin}(1\\dot{+}$ $\\bar{k}^{*})-{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}\\delta^{2}]^{2}+\\delta^{2}\\}$ is the (constant) variance per year atributable to jumps. However, the sample path for spot variance estimated under the SvJD model involved a reflection off the minimum value of $V_{j u m p}=(0.072)^{2}$ (see Figure 1), whereas the path estimated under the SV model never approached the reflecting barrier at $V_{t}=0$ More comparable to standard Black-Scholes implicit variances is the expected average variance\n\n$$\nE\\overline{V} = V_{jump} + w(T)V_t + [1 - w(T)]\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta^*} \\tag{27}\n$$\n\nfor $w(T)=(1-e^{-\\beta^{*}T})/\\beta^{*}T\\in\\left(0,1\\right)$ The expected average variance is a maturity-dependent weighted average of the spot variance $V_{j u m p}+V_{t}$ and the steady-state variance $V_{j u m p}+\\alpha/\\beta^{*}$ . Given estimated slow mean reversion, the estimated expected average variance for 0- to 6-month options was close to the spot variance and is consequently not shown.\n\nDespite the improved fit relative to Black-Scholes, the conditional standard errors of the stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion model shown in Table 3 are still large. Freely parameterized option pricing models involving daily parameter reestimation typically yield substantially lower overall root mean squared error, on the order of 0.04 percent of the underlying asset price; examples include the constrained cubic spline and Merton (1976) jump-diffusion models in Bates (1991, 1994). While ad boc, such models do satisfy option-specific, no-arbitrage constraints and therefore generate theoretically valid option prices\n\n---\n\n[^1]: Bates (1994) finds that implicit excess kurtosis in DM and yen futures options tended to increase as option maturities decreased, but not as fast as predicted by Merton's (1976) jump-diffusion model.\n\n<!-- Page:18 -->\n\n<center><i>Figure 1 Instantaneous conditional (spot) volatility implicit in deutsche mark options, 1984-1991.

The implications are that specification error is large relative to other sources of error, and that the postulated model fails to capture major changes in implicit distributions over time.\n\nFurther evidence of parametric instability is revealed in implicit parameter estimates over two-year subsamples; see Table 4. The major problem is that the postulated one-factor model for expected average variances in Equation (27) fails to capture the evolution over time of the term structure of implicit volatilities across short-term (0 to 3 month) and medium-term (3 to 6 month) maturities. Whereas the term structure was essentially flat in 1984 to 1985, as indicated by a long half-life to volatility shocks, steeper term structures were observed in subsequent years. Evolutions in other moments were also observed; implicit distributions were substantially positively skewed over the period 1984 to 1987, but were essentially symmetric over the period 1988 to 1991. Substantial implicit excess kurtosis was present in all biannual subsamples.\n\nParameter instability explains the apparent puzzle in Table 3 that average pricing errors for short-term in-the-money calls and out-of-the-money puts diverge in sign, whereas put-call parity (for the European portion of the option prices) implies that the pricing errors should be comparable in sign and magnitude.

Tests of Consistency with the Underlying Time Series\n\n### 3.1 Tests of consistency with the time series properties of implicit volatilities\n\nAs noted by Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985), the transition density of $y=2c V_{t+\\Delta t}$ conditional on $V_{t}$ is noncentral $\\chi^{2}(4\\alpha/\\sigma_{v}^{2},~2c V_{t}e^{-\\dot{\\beta}\\Delta t})$ where $c^{-\\mathrm{i}}\\equiv{\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\sigma_{v}^{2}(1-e^{-\\beta\\Delta t})/\\beta$ and $\\beta$ is the actual rate of mean reversion of the volatility process (as distinct from the risk-adjusted parameter $\\beta^{*}$ implicit in option prices):\n\n$$\np(y \\mid V_t) = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(y + \\Lambda)} y^{\\frac{1}{2}v - 1}}{2^{\\frac{1}{2}v}} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{4}y\\Lambda\\right)^j}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{2}v + j\\right) j!} \\tag{28}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\nu\\equiv4\\alpha/\\sigma_{\\nu}^{2}$ , $\\Lambda\\equiv2c V_{t}e^{-\\beta\\Delta t}$ , and $\\Gamma(\\cdot)$ is the gamma function. However, the noncentral $\\chi^{2}$ density function has infinite value at $2c V_{t+\\Delta t}=0$ when the reflecting barrier is attainable $\\begin{array}{r}{(\\frac{1}{2}\\nu<1)}\\end{array}$ , yielding nonsensical results when the sample path $\\{V_{t}\\}$ is among the parameters to be estimated. Consequently, the applications below use the transition density of the monotonic transformation $\\ln(V_{t+\\Delta t})$ , which has finite density everywhere:\n\n$$\np(\\ln V_{t+\\Delta t} \\mid V_t) = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(e^z + \\Lambda)} (e^z)^{\\frac{1}{2}v}}{2^{\\frac{1}{2}v}} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\frac{1}{4}e^z \\Lambda)^j}{\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2}v + j) j!} \\tag{29}\n$$\n\nwhere $e^{z}=2c V_{t+\\Delta t}$ .\n\nMaximum likelihood estimates of the parameters $\\{\\alpha,\\beta,\\sigma_{\\nu}\\}$ using the time series of implicit instantaneous conditional volatilities $\\{V_{t}\\}$ diverge substantially from the parameters $\\{\\alpha,\\beta^{*},\\sigma_{\\upsilon}\\}$ estimated crosssectionally from option prices, as is shown in Table 5 (sV and sVJD models). In particular, the volatility of variance parameter $\\sigma_{\\upsilon}$ implicit in option prices is substantially higher than the supposedly identical parameter estimated off the time series properties of $\\{V_{t}\\}$ . The parameters $\\pmb{\\alpha}$ and $\\beta$ affecting the drift are estimated with less precision; nevertheless, there is a significant deviation.\n\nGiven noisy option prices, however, the above two-step estimation procedure does not constitute a formal test of the hypothesis of identical $\\{\\alpha,\\sigma_{v}\\}$ parameters for option prices and time series. Under the assumptions that option residuals are appropriately modeled by Equation (23) and are independent of volatility realizations, the appropriate\n\n<!-- Page:22 -->\n\n<center><i>Table5 Unconstrained and constrained maximum Hikelihood estimates of stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion parameters </i></center>\n\n|                       | Jump parameters |     |     |               | Stochastic volatility parameters |       |       |       |       |     | Half-life | $\\ln L_{options}$ |\n|-----------------------|----------------|-----|-----|---------------|--------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----|-----------|-------------------|\n|                       | $\\lambda^{*}$  | $\\bar{k}^{*}$ | $\\delta$ | $\\sqrt{V_{jump}}$ | $\\alpha$ | $\\beta^{*}$, $\\beta$ | $\\sigma_{v}$ | $\\rho$ | $\\sqrt{\\alpha/\\beta^{*}}$, $\\sqrt{\\alpha/\\beta}$ | (months) | ln $L_{\\{V\\}}$ |\n| Unconstrained implicit parameter estimation (SV) |               |     |     |               |                                |       |       |       |       |     |           |                   |\n| Options               | .031           | 1.30 | .285 | .045          | .155                           | .001  | .01   | .005  | .002  | .002 | 6.4       | 120,644.45        |\n| Resulting $\\{V_t\\}$   | .058           | 3.55 | .140 |               | .128                           | .015  | 1.01  | .005  | .007  | .7   | 2.3       | 162.91            |\n| Constrained estimation (SVC) |               |     |     |               |                                |       |       |       |       |     |           |                   |\n| Options               |                |      |      |                | .50                            | .013  | .09   | .052  | .006  | .006 | 16.7      | 120,557.97        |\n| $\\{V_t^c\\}$           |                |      |      |                | .72                            | .002  | .53   |       | .048  | 8.6  | 11.5      | 174.84            |\n| $\\{V_t^c\\}$           |                |      |      |                | .053                           | .105  | .96   | .114  | .007  | .8   | 2.6       | 243.16            |\n| Unconstrained implicit parameter estimation (SVJD) |              |     |     |               |                                |       |       |       |       |     |           |                   |\n| Options               | 15.01          | -0.001 | 0.19 | .072          | .19                            | 1.21  | .000  | .001  | .001  | .001 | 10.6      | 120,699.27        |\n| Resulting $\\{V_t\\}$   | .001           | .04  | .168 |               | .197                           | .001  | .81   | .006  | 2.146 | 4945.1 | 225.8     | -14.71            |\n\n<!-- Page:23 -->\n\n<center><i>Table 5 continued </i></center>"
