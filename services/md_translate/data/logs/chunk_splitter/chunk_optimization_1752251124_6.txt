"text_a": "Table 3 shows that both types of risk premia are estimated to be positive. The coefficient $\\mu-\\mu^{*}$ associated with the premia for jump-size uncertainty is estimated to be $18.4\\%$ with a standard error of $4\\%$ , while the coefficient $\\eta^{v}$ associated with the premia for volatility risk is estimated to be 3 with a standard error of 2. Compared with the estimates for the SVJ0 model, which imposes the constraint $\\eta^{v}=0$ $^{9}$; we see a reduction in jump-risk premia $\\lambda$ is reduced by half) accompanying the positive volatility-risk premia. By taking advantage of the additional time series of ITM call options, we can better pin down the jump-risk premia. The coefficient $\\eta^{v}$ for the volatility-risk premia, however, still cannot be precisely measured. Searching for possible tensions in the system, we repeat the goodness-of-fit tests (as those reported in Table 2) for this model. The $p$ -value of the overall goodness-of-fit test is 0.40. We also examine the goodness of fit by looking at the over-identifying restriction introduced by the additional moment condition Eq. (5.1). The $p$ -value for that test is 0.58.\n\nThe SVJ model extends the SVJ0 model by allowing both the jump- and the volatility-risk premia to play a role in option pricing. For intuition purpose, we offer some approximate estimates of the breakdown between the two types of risk premia. Consider a one-month option traded at $10\\%$ market volatility.

If the option is a $5\\%$ OTM put, then the jump-risk premium component increases to $80\\%$ , but for a $5\\%$ OTM call option the percentage decreases to $30\\%$ . In other words, investors are more worried about jump risk in OTM puts than OTM calls.\n\nSimilarly, the effect of risk premia also shows up in the underling stock prices.

Measuring the average volatility level by its long run-mean $\\bar{v}$ ; the SVJmodel estimates imply that the average mean excess rate of (cum-dividend) return demanded for the diffusive return risk is $5.5\\%$ per year (with a standard deviation of $3.4\\%$ ), while that demanded for the jump risk is $3.5\\%$ per year (with a standard deviation of $0.7\\%$ ). This shows that a significant portion of the equity risk premium is assigned as a premium to compensate for investors aversion to jumps. Given that less than $3\\%$ of the total return variance is due to jump risk, these numbers suggest that compensation for jump risk is very different from that for diffusive risk.\n\nFinally, recall that the SVJ model sets the jump-timing risk premium $\\lambda^{*}-\\lambda$ to zero. To gauge its impact on the estimated premium for the jump-size risk (measured in terms of $\\mu^{*}-\\mu$), we estimate $\\lambda^{*}$ and $\\lambda$ as two free parameters.[^1] Our finding with respect to the premium for jump-size uncertainty remains robust: $\\mu^{*}-\\mu$ is estimated to be $-17.7\\%$ with a standard error of $1.7\\%$. The estimate for $\\lambda$, however, is very different from those obtained under the constraint $\\lambda^{*}=\\lambda$. In particular, we find $\\lambda^{*}<\\lambda$, implying a negative jump-timing risk premium. This result could be due to the fact that different types of jumps coexist in the data. To ensure a non-negative jumptiming risk premium, we perform the same estimation under the constraint that $\\lambda^{*}\\geqslant\\lambda$. The constraint is found to be binding and the estimates are close to those reported in Table 3. In short, the evidence in support of the premium for jump-size uncertainty is robust with respect to the constraint of zero jump-timing risk premium.\n\n### 5.3. Implications on cross-sectional option prices\n\nIn this section, we extend our analysis to cross-sectional option data. (Details on data collection are given in Section 4.3.) Equipped with the time-series estimation results summarized in Tables 1 and 3, we examine the extent to which these models correctly price the cross-sectional options data observed in the market.\n\nTable 4 summarizes the cross-sectional pricing errors, which are measured as the absolute differences between the model-implied and the market-observed option prices, both measured in terms of the Black\u2013Scholes implied volatility. This avoids placing undue weight on expensive options, such as deep-in-the-money or longerdated options. The positive and negative signs in the parentheses indicate whether, on average, the model over-prices or under-prices. As a gauge of how big the mispricings are in real terms, we also provide the average bid/ask spreads\u2014the difference between offer and ask prices, each measured in terms of BS vol. For a pictorial exposition, Fig. 5 plots the volatility smiles (across different maturities) on a medium-volatility day, while Figs. 6 and 7, respectively, plot the volatility smiles on the most and least volatile days in our sample.\n\nOverall, the ability of the SVJ0 model to capture the volatility smirks is quite remarkable, given only one option a day (marked by circles in Figs. 5\u20137) is used to obtain the SVJ0 model estimates, while the rest of the options in the cross-sectional data is purely out of sample.

This is to be compared with the findings of Eraker (2000), who, using the specification of constant jump arrival intensity, finds that such a jump model cannot generate sufficiently steep smile curves on high-volatility days. This reinforces our earlier discussion in Section 5.1 on the importance of the state-dependent nature of the jump-risk premia. In particular, this state-dependent jump-risk premium is crucial not only for reconciling the spot and option dynamics, but also for explaining the changes over time of the smile curves.\n\nWhile it can capture the volatility smirks relatively well, the SVJ0 model consistently under-prices medium and long-dated options on days of high volatility, and over-prices them on days of low volatility. This is closely related to the inability of the one-factor volatility model to capture the rich term structure of volatility implied by the data. As will be discussed in Section 5.4, the SVJ0 model reverts to its long-run mean too rapidly, compared with what is implied by the data. Consequently it under-prices long-dated options on high-volatility days and overprices these options on low-volatility days.\n\nOn days of high and low volatilities, we also observe a large volume of quotes for deep-in-the-money puts, whose prices none of our models is capable of explaining. This \u2018\u2018tipping-at-the-end\u2019\u2019 behavior seems to require more randomness on the right tail of the underlying return distribution under the risk-neutral measure than that suggested by the estimated models. A possible solution is to allow jumps in volatility.\n\n<!-- Page:25 -->\n\n<center><i>Fig. 6. Smiles curves on the most volatile day of the sample.

This result is not novel. Fitting this class of stochastic volatility models directly to cross-sectional option prices, Bates (2000) and Bakshi et al. (1997) arrive at the same conclusion. Table 4 shows that the SV model severely over-prices long-dated options. As discussed in Section 5.1, the SV model relies on volatility-risk premia to explain the risk premia implicit in shortdated options. In doing so, the volatility-risk premia are severely overstated, resulting in an explosive volatility process under the \u2018\u2018risk-neutral\u2019\u2019 measure, which, in turn, over-prices long-dated options.\n\n### 5.4. Diagnostic tests on model mis-specifications\n\nThis section examines possible mis-specifications of the volatility dynamics.\n\n---\n\n26Given tat tipriaedbth tri tat prifrist diagnostic tests in this section and the goodness-of-fit tests in Table 2 are joint tests on the dynamics and the pricing kernel. The motivations for these tests, however, are different. In particular, the diagnostic tests designed in this section focus on the part of volatility dynamics that is less sensitive to the misspecifications in pricing kernel. To illustrate this point, the diagnostic tests are performed for the four different models with very different specifications of pricing kernels.\n\n<!-- Page:26 -->\n\n<center><i>Fig. 7.

Moreover, our results indicate that the SVJ0 model can\n\n---\n\nDetails are available upon requst.\n\n<!-- Page:23 -->\n\n<center><i> </i></center>\n| τ<60 | Days of high volatility | Days of medium volatility | Days of low volatility |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|      | $k<0.97$ | $[0.97,1.03]$ | $k>1.03$ | $k<0.97$ | $[0.97,1.03]$ | $k>1.03$ | $k<0.97$ | $[0.97,1.03]$ | $k>1.03$ |\n| SV0  | 5.5 | 3.9 | 5.4 | 2.1 | 2.9 | 2.9 | 1.6 | 0.8 | 4.6 |\n| SV   | 7.8 | 9.1 | 5.1 | 1.8 | 5.0 | 2.8 | 1.0 | 0.9 | 4.4 |\n| SVJ0 | 6.4 | 6.6 | 2.3 | 1.8 | 5.7 | 2.8 | 2.8 | 0.7 | 4.7 |\n| SVJITM | 2.6 | 1.6 | 2.5 | 1.7 | 5.2 | 0.6 | 1.0 | 0.8 | 4.0 |\n| Bid/ask | 1.9 | 1.0 | 3.2 | 1.3 | 3.9 | 2.7 | 2.3 | 0.5 | 2.8 |\n| 60≤τ<180 | 5.3 | 4.2 | 3.0 | 2.1 | 0.9 | 0.5 | 0.7 | 0.6 | 1.6 |\n| SV0  | 2.8 | 2.6 | 4.2 | 1.5 | 2.1 | 3.1 | 1.5 | 2.2 | 3.2 |\n| SV   | 3.4 | 3.6 | 3.9 | 0.6 | 0.3 | 0.4 | 2.1 | 1.1 | 2.5 |\n| SVJ0 | 2.2 | 1.8 | 1.9 | 0.9 | 0.9 | 1.4 | 2.0 | 1.7 | 3.6 |\n| SVJITM | 1.9 | 1.0 | 1.8 | 0.9 | 0.6 | 0.9 | 1.0 | 0.4 | 1.4 |\n| Bid/ask | 1.7 | 1.0 | 1.3 | 0.8 | 0.7 | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.4 | 0.6 |\n| τ≥180 | 5.5 | 3.9 | 3.3 | 2.1 | 0.9 | 0.5 | 0.7 | 0.6 | 1.6 |\n| SV0  | 2.8 | 2.6 | 4.2 | 1.5 | 2.1 | 3.1 | 1.5 | 2.2 | 3.2 |\n| SV   | 3.4 | 3.6 | 3.9 | 0.6 | 0.3 | 0.4 | 2.1 | 1.1 | 2.5 |\n| SVJ0 | 2.2 | 1.8 | 1.9 | 0.9 | 0.9 | 1.4 | 2.0 | 1.7 | 3.6 |\n| SVJITM | 1.9 | 1.0 | 1.8 | 0.9 | 0.6 | 0.9 | 1.0 | 0.4 | 1.4 |\n| Bid/ask | 1.7 | 1.0 | 1.3 | 0.8 | 0.7 | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.4 | 0.6 |\n\n<center>\n<div style=\"display: inline-block; text-align: left; max-width: 80%;\">\n<i>注：数据来自于统计调查</i>\n</div>\n</center>\n\n<!-- Page:24 -->\n\n<center><i>Fig.5.

This is to be compared with the findings of Eraker (2000), who, using the specification of constant jump arrival intensity, finds that such a jump model cannot generate sufficiently steep smile curves on high-volatility days. This reinforces our earlier discussion in Section 5.1 on the importance of the state-dependent nature of the jump-risk premia. In particular, this state-dependent jump-risk premium is crucial not only for reconciling the spot and option dynamics, but also for explaining the changes over time of the smile curves.\n\nWhile it can capture the volatility smirks relatively well, the SVJ0 model consistently under-prices medium and long-dated options on days of high volatility, and over-prices them on days of low volatility. This is closely related to the inability of the one-factor volatility model to capture the rich term structure of volatility implied by the data. As will be discussed in Section 5.4, the SVJ0 model reverts to its long-run mean too rapidly, compared with what is implied by the data. Consequently it under-prices long-dated options on high-volatility days and overprices these options on low-volatility days.\n\nOn days of high and low volatilities, we also observe a large volume of quotes for deep-in-the-money puts, whose prices none of our models is capable of explaining. This ‘‘tipping-at-the-end’’ behavior seems to require more randomness on the right tail of the underlying return distribution under the risk-neutral measure than that suggested by the estimated models. A possible solution is to allow jumps in volatility.\n\n<!-- Page:25 -->\n\n<center><i>Fig. 6. Smiles curves on the most volatile day of the sample.

This result is not novel. Fitting this class of stochastic volatility models directly to cross-sectional option prices, Bates (2000) and Bakshi et al. (1997) arrive at the same conclusion. Table 4 shows that the SV model severely over-prices long-dated options. As discussed in Section 5.1, the SV model relies on volatility-risk premia to explain the risk premia implicit in shortdated options. In doing so, the volatility-risk premia are severely overstated, resulting in an explosive volatility process under the ‘‘risk-neutral’’ measure, which, in turn, over-prices long-dated options.\n\n### 5.4. Diagnostic tests on model mis-specifications\n\nThis section examines possible mis-specifications of the volatility dynamics.\n\n---\n\n26Given tat tipriaedbth tri tat prifrist diagnostic tests in this section and the goodness-of-fit tests in Table 2 are joint tests on the dynamics and the pricing kernel. The motivations for these tests, however, are different. In particular, the diagnostic tests designed in this section focus on the part of volatility dynamics that is less sensitive to the misspecifications in pricing kernel. To illustrate this point, the diagnostic tests are performed for the four different models with very different specifications of pricing kernels.\n\n<!-- Page:26 -->\n\n<center><i>Fig. 7.
