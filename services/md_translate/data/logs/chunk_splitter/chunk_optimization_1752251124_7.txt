"text_a": "option-implied volatility $\\{V_{n}^{\\vartheta}\\}$ : For example, Fig. 8 plots the series $\\{\\sqrt{V_{n}^{9}}\\}$ for the SVJO model.[^1] Taking advantage of the option-implied volatility series, our diagnostic tests focus on two issues: (1) the term structure of volatility and (2) jumps in volatility.\n\nGiven that there have been extensive empirical studies conducted on the stochastic-volatility models with jumps, it is instructive for us to first compare our model estimates\u2014the subset associated with the data-generating process\u2014with those reported in time-series studies using stock indices alone. Taking the SVJ0 model estimates (Table 1), for example, we have $\\kappa_{v}=7$ ; $\\sqrt{\\bar{v}}=11\\%$ ; $\\sigma_{v}=0.28$ ; and $\\rho=-0.5$ : This is compared with $\\kappa_{v}=3.2$ ; $\\sqrt{\\bar{v}}=14\\%$ ; $\\sigma_{v}=0.24$ ; and $\\rho=-0.47$ reported by Eraker et al. (2000), and $\\kappa_{v}=3.4$ ; $\\sqrt{\\bar{v}}=13\\%$ ; $\\sigma_{v}=0.17$ ; and $\\rho=-0.33$ reported by Andersen et al. (1998). Our estimate of the long-run mean of volatility is slightly lower because our sample period falls into a less volatile period than theirs. Overall, our estimates are of the same order of magnitude. This is quite remarkable, given that their volatility estimates rely on the time series of the S&P 500 index, while\n\n---\n\n[^1]: We plot $\\{\\sqrt{V_{n}^{9}}\\}$ in Fig.so that adiret comparisonan made with thBlack-Sholeslid volatility (Fig. 1). While the time-series patterns are similar, the levels of inferred volatility are quite different. In particular, because of the different risk-premium structures of the two models, the volatilities inferred from using the Black-Scholes model are higher than those inferred from using the SVJO model.\n\n<!-- Page:27 -->\n\n<center><i>Fig. 8.

The cross-sectional analysis of Duffe et al.

(2001) find that these two types of jumps have distinctively different implications for investors asset allocation. Potentially, one could also identify these two types of risk premia using options with different moneyness, which react differently to these two types of jump risks. For example, OTM puts are more sensitive to negative price jumps than OTM calls, and the price jump-risk premia documented in this paper play an important role in capturing this cross-sectional pattern. The cross-sectional analysis of Duffe et al. (20o0) indicates that the role of risk-neutral volatility jumps differs from that of risk-neutral price jumps, indicating that the two types of risk premia could be important in capturing the cross-sectional behavior in different ways.\n\n<!-- Page:30 -->"
