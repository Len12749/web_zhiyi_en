"text_a": "where $\\mu$ is the instantaneous expected rate of appreciation of the foreign currency, $\\lambda$ is the annual frequency of jumps, $k$ is the random percentage jump conditional on a jump occurring, and $q$ is a Poisson counter with intensity $\\lambda$\n\nThe postulated exchange rate process offers a rich and flexible distributional structure. Skewed distributions can arise either because of correlations between exchange rate or volatility shocks, or because of nonzero average jumps. Similarly, excess kurtosis can arise either from volatile volatility or from a substantial jump component. Furthermore, the two alternate explanations for skewness and excess kurtosis can\n\n<!-- Page:3 -->\n\nbe distinguished by holding period effects. Stochastic volatility implies a direct relationship between the length of the holding period and the magnitude of conditional skewness and excess kurtosis, whereas jumps imply a strong inverse relationship.\n\nThe above process for volatility has been used for pricing options under two polar assumptions about interest rate processes. Bailey and Stulz (1989) and Bossaerts and Hillion (1993) price stock index and stock options using the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) general equilibrium production economy, which implies instantaneous conditional variances and interest rates are proportional and follow the square root process above. On the other hand, Hull and white (1988) and Heston (1993) price options off the above stochastic volatility process under the more tractable assumption of constant interest rates. Since Scott (1993) finds that interest rate volatility has little impact on short-term option prices such as those examined in this study, the latter assumption of constant domestic and foreign interest rates will be maintained in this study.\n\nThe square root variance process has two major advantages. First, the model can allow for systematic volatility risk, whereas alternate processes such as Hull and white (1987) have had to impose the assumption of nonsystematic volatility risk to generate a tractable option pricing model. If the true process is given by Equation (1), then in a representative agent production economy [see Bates (1988)] the risk neutral processes used in pricing options that incorporate the appropriate compensation for jump risk and volatility risk are given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align} \ndS/S &= (b - \\lambda * k^*)dt + \\sqrt{V}dZ^* + k^*dq^* \\nonumber\\\\ \ndV &= [\\alpha - \\beta V + \\Phi_v]dt + \\sigma_v\\sqrt{V}dZ_v^* \\nonumber\\\\ \n\\mathrm{cov}(dZ^*, dZ_v^*) &= \\rho dt \\nonumber\\\\ \n\\mathrm{prob}(dq^* = 1) &= \\lambda^* dt, \\quad k \\sim (\\bar{k}^*, \\mathrm{Var}(k^*)) \n\\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nwhere $^{b}$ is the continuously compounded domestic/foreign interest differential, and starred variables represent the risk-adjusted versions of the true variables, taking into account the pricing of jump risk and volatility risk.

More precisely, such effects are assumed here to affect only the foreign currency risk premium $E(d S/S)^{-}-(r-\\dot{r}^{*})=\\mu-b$ and therefore have no effect on option prices. The potential general equilibrium effects of the omitted state variables on interest rates and on volatility are ruled out by the imposed distributional assumptions. For an illustration of the (limited) general equilibrium impact of investor heterogeneity on interest rates see Dumas (1989).\n\n[^6]: The specification of the risk neutral process depends on the choice of numeraire. The above specification of Equations (2) and (3) is the risk neutral process for the $\\$/\\mathsf{FC}$ exchange rate $s$ to be used in generating dollar-denominated prices of foreign currency options. For foreign-currency denominated option prices expressed in terms of the $\\mathbf{FC}/\\S$ exchange rates $1/S$, it is necessary to use the marginal utility of foreign-currency denominated wealth $\\bar{J_{u},*}=S\\bar{J_{u}}$, when computing $\\Phi_{\\nu}$, $\\lambda^{*}$, and $\\bar{k}^{\\star}$. An Ito's lemma-based transformation of variables of the process in Equation (2) using $z\\equiv S^{-1}$ is not correct, because of Siegel's paradox.\n\n[^7]: The additional restriction that the process for optimally invested wealth follows a geometric volatility/jump-diffusion process with constant parameters is also required. See Ingersoll(1987, chap. 18) for a discussion of a similar issue with regard to the term structure of interest rates.\n\n[^8]: Strict linearity of the volatility risk premium can be supported under log utility when exchange rate volatility and market risk have a common component of a particular form. The linear specification will not typically emerge under more general preferences (e.g.,time-separable power utility) and should be viewed for such preferences as an approximation to the true functional form. Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) use a similar approximation when modeling the risk premium on interest rates.\n\n<!-- Page:5 -->\n\nNote, however, that the variance steady-state level $(\\alpha/\\beta^{*})$ and rate of mean reversion $\\beta^{*}$ implicit in option prices are not the true levels, but differ by an amount that depends on the volatility risk premium.\n\nThe second major advantage to the square root process for variance is that the process generates an analytically tractable method of pricing options without sacrificing accuracy or requiring undesirable restrictions (such as $\\rho=0,$ ) on parameter values. European options that can be exercised only at maturity are priced as the expected value of their terminal payoffs under the risk neutral probability measure:\n\n$$\nc = e^{-rT} E^* \\max(S_T - X, 0) \\\\ = e^{-rT} \\left[ \\int_X^\\infty S_T p^*(S_T) dS_T - X \\int_X^\\infty p^*(S_T) dS_T \\right] \\\\ = e^{-rT} (FP_1 - XP_2) \\tag{6}\n$$\n\nwhere $E^{*}$ is the expectation with respect to the risk-neutral probability measure; $F=\\bar{E^{*}}(S_{T})=S_{0}e^{b T}$ is the forward price on foreign currency; $P_{2}=\\text{prob}^{*}(S_{T}>X)$ is one minus the risk neutral distribution function; and $P_{1}=\\int_{X}^{\\infty}[S_{T}/E^{*}(S_{T})]p^{*}(S_{T})d S_{T}$ is also a probability (since the integrand is nonnegative and the integral over $\\lbrack0,\\infty)$ is one). For instance, the Garman and Kohlhagen (1983) variant of the Black and Scholes formula for foreign currency options under the assumption of constant-volatility geometric Brownian motion for the exchange rate is\n\n$$\nc = e^{-rT} [FN(d_1) - XN(d_2)] \\tag{7}\n$$\n\nwhere d = [ln(F/X) + o2T]/o\u221aT, and d2 = d - \u03b1\u221aT.\n\nThe European option evaluation problem is to evaluate $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ under the distributional assumptions embedded in the risk neutral probability measure. The difficulty is that the cumulative distribution function for most distributions is messy and, in many cases, we do not have any idea of what it looks like. Even the Black and Scholes\n\n<!-- Page:6 -->\n\nmodel has a distribution related to the error function, which is nontrivial to evaluate. When it comes to stochastic volatility models, the distribution function is unknown. The difficulty in evaluating $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ is responsible for a bias toward series solutions for pricing options.\n\nHeston (1993) pointed out that it is much easier to solve for the moment generating functions associated with $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ . Essentially one can view the moment generating function as a contingent claim to be solved using the standard contingent claims' partial differential equation under relatively easy boundary conditions; details are in the Appendix. (The P's also solve the equation--subject, however, to discontinuous boundary conditions that preclude easy solutions.) Once one has the moment generating function, there exist fast numerical procedures for evaluating Pi and P2. The resulting moment generating functions of $\\ln(S_{T}/S_{0})$ for the two probabilities $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ when exchange rates follow a combination stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion process are given by\n\n$$\nF_j(\\Phi \\mid V, T) \\equiv E[e^{\\Phi \\ln(S_T/S_0)} \\mid P_j] \\qquad (j = 1, 2) \\\\ = \\exp\\{C_j(T; \\Phi) + D_j(T; \\Phi)V + \\lambda^* T (1 + \\bar{k}^*)^{\\mu_j + 1/2} \\\\ \\times [(1 + \\bar{k}^*)^\\Phi e^{\\delta^2(\\mu_j \\Phi + \\phi^2/2)} - 1]\\} \\tag{8}\n$$",

By the properties of characteristic functions, the integral is real-valued and the probability can also be written as[^1]\n\n$$\nprob^*(S_T e^{b \\Delta t_1} > X \\mid F_j) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\text{imag}[F_j(i \\Phi) e^{-i \\Phi x}]}{\\Phi} \\, d\\Phi. \\tag{13}\n$$\n\nThe probability density function of $\\ln(S_{T}/S_{0})$ under the risk neutral probability measure has a similar form:\n\n$$\np^{*}(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F_2(i\\Phi) e^{-i\\Phi z} \\, d\\Phi \\\\ = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\text{real}[F_2(i\\Phi) e^{-i\\Phi z}] \\, d\\Phi \\tag{14}\n$$\n\nwhere $z\\equiv\\ln(S_{T}/S_{0})$\n\nThe integrals in Equations (13) and (14) can be evaluated efficiently via Gaussian quadrature. A Gauss-Kronrod rule based on IMSL subroutine DQDNG that evaluated $F_{j}(i\\Phi)$ at up to 87 points over a truncated domain was found to be accurate to $10^{-8}$ times the spot exchange rate (four orders of magnitude less than the minimum price change), except for extreme and implausible jump parameters. Since pricing call and put options of a common maturity and variance require the same values of $F_{j}(i\\Phi)$ regardless of the strike price/spot price ratio, enormous efficiency gains can be realized by evaluating all such options simultaneously.\n\nThe above procedure gives the price of a European option as a function of state variables and parameters:\n\n$$\nc(S, V, T; X, \\theta) = e^{-r(T+\\Delta t_i)} [FP_1 - XP_2] \\tag{15}\n$$\n\nfor $\\theta=\\langle\\lambda^{*},\\bar{k}^{*},\\delta,\\alpha,\\beta^{*},\\sigma_{\\nu},\\rho\\rangle$ . However, since the PHLX options on foreign currency are American, it is important, in principle, to take into account the extra value accruing from the ability to exercise the options prior to maturity.

The approximation error is substantially smaller for shorter-maturity put options and for puts with different strike prices.

Estimation\n\n### 2.1 Data\n\nTransactions data for deutsche mark foreign currency options were obtained for January 1984 to June 1991 from the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Prior to September 26, 1987, only options maturing in March, June, September, or December were traded, with contract specifications geared to the corresponding IMM foreign currency futures contracts in size (62,500 deutsche marks, half the size of the IMM futures contracts) and maturity (third Wednesday of the contract month). Trading in contracts maturing the nearest other two months began on September 27, 1987. The options are American, and could be exercised at any time up to and including the Saturday preceding the third Wednesday of the contract month.\n\nRoughly 1 percent of the records mildly violated early exercise constraints, presumably due to measurement error in matching up the underlying futures price. Since discarding these data would bias upward average in-the-money option prices, influencing the implicit parameter estimation, these data were retained. There was also no attempt to weed out thinly traded option contracts, apart from the fact that those contracts by their nature received a low weighting in the regressions. A few obviously erroneous data (0.1 percent of the total data) were discarded.\n\nOnly a subset of the full data set was used in this study. First, only trades on Wednesdays were considered, yielding a weekly frequency panel data set. Daily sampling would place extreme demands on computer memory and time, and would involve issues of modeling day-of-the-week volatility effects that I do not wish to explore at this time. Second, only morning trades (9 A.M. to 12 P.M. EST) were considered\u2014a trade-off between shortening the interval for greater synchronicity and lengthening it to get more observations. Third, only options with March/June/September/December maturities and with 6 months or less to maturity were used\u2014for a maximum of two option maturities per day. The resulting data set consists of 19,689 transactions (11,952 calls; 7,737 puts) on 372 Wednesday mornings.\n\n---\n\n14 Fifty percent of the daily trades over the period 1984 to 1991 took place between 9 A.M. and 12 P.M. The greatest activity was between 9 A.M. and 10:30 A.M., when U.S. and European markets were open simultaneously.\n\n<!-- Page:10 -->\n\n<center><i>Table 1 Prices of European and American put options in <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\\phi/\\mathbf{DM}\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; height: 1.2em;\" alt=\"\\phi/\\mathbf{DM}\" class=\"latex-formula\"/> evaluated by Fourier, finite-difference, and quadratic approximation method.

For instance, the Garman and Kohlhagen (1983) variant of the Black and Scholes formula for foreign currency options under the assumption of constant-volatility geometric Brownian motion for the exchange rate is\n\n$$\nc = e^{-rT} [FN(d_1) - XN(d_2)] \\tag{7}\n$$\n\nwhere d = [ln(F/X) + o2T]/o\\u221aT, and d2 = d - \\u03b1\\u221aT.\n\nThe European option evaluation problem is to evaluate $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ under the distributional assumptions embedded in the risk neutral probability measure. The difficulty is that the cumulative distribution function for most distributions is messy and, in many cases, we do not have any idea of what it looks like. Even the Black and Scholes\n\n<!-- Page:6 -->\n\nmodel has a distribution related to the error function, which is nontrivial to evaluate. When it comes to stochastic volatility models, the distribution function is unknown. The difficulty in evaluating $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ is responsible for a bias toward series solutions for pricing options.\n\nHeston (1993) pointed out that it is much easier to solve for the moment generating functions associated with $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ . Essentially one can view the moment generating function as a contingent claim to be solved using the standard contingent claims' partial differential equation under relatively easy boundary conditions; details are in the Appendix. (The P's also solve the equation--subject, however, to discontinuous boundary conditions that preclude easy solutions.) Once one has the moment generating function, there exist fast numerical procedures for evaluating Pi and P2. The resulting moment generating functions of $\\ln(S_{T}/S_{0})$ for the two probabilities $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ when exchange rates follow a combination stochastic volatility/jump-diffusion process are given by\n\n$$\nF_j(\\Phi \\mid V, T) \\equiv E[e^{\\Phi \\ln(S_T/S_0)} \\mid P_j] \\qquad (j = 1, 2) \\\\ = \\exp\\{C_j(T; \\Phi) + D_j(T; \\Phi)V + \\lambda^* T (1 + \\bar{k}^*)^{\\mu_j + 1/2} \\\\ \\times [(1 + \\bar{k}^*)^\\Phi e^{\\delta^2(\\mu_j \\Phi + \\phi^2/2)} - 1]\\} \\tag{8}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nC_j(T; \\Phi) = (b - \\lambda^* \\bar{k}^*) \\Phi T - \\frac{\\alpha T}{\\sigma_v^2} (\\rho \\sigma_v \\Phi - \\beta_j - \\gamma_j) - \\frac{2 \\alpha}{\\sigma_v^2} \\ln \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{2} (\\rho \\sigma_v \\Phi - \\beta_j - \\gamma_j) \\frac{1 - e^{\\gamma_j T}}{\\gamma_j} \\right], \\tag{9}\n$$\n\n$$\nD_j(T; \\Phi) = -2\\frac{\\mu_j \\Phi + \\frac{1}{2} \\Phi^2}{\\rho \\sigma_v \\Phi - \\beta_j + \\gamma_j \\frac{1+e^{\\eta_j T}}{1-e^{\\eta_j T}}}, \\tag{10}\n$$\n\n$$\nY_j = \\sqrt{(\\rho \\delta_v \\Phi - \\beta_j)^2} - 2 \\delta_v (\\mu_j \\Phi + \\frac{1}{2} \\Phi), \\tag{11}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\mu_{1} = +\\frac{1}{2}, \\mu_{2} = -\\frac{1}{2}, \\beta_{1} = \\beta^{*} - \\rho\\sigma_{v}, \\text{ and } \\beta_{2} = \\beta^{*}.\n$$\n\nGiven the above solutions for the moment generating functions, the relevant tail probabilities $P_{j}(\\Phi\\mid S_{0},T)=j r{\\tilde{o}}b^{*}(S_{T}e^{b\\Delta{\\tilde{t}}_{1}}>X\\mid F_{j})$ for evaluating PHLX options can be determined numerically via Fourier inversion of the complex-valued characteristic function $F_{j}(i\\Phi\\mid S_{0},T)$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{prob}^*(S_T e^{b\\Delta t_i} > X \\mid F_j) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{F_j(i\\Phi)e^{-i\\Phi x}}{i\\Phi} d\\Phi \\tag{12}\n$$\n\nwhere $x\\equiv\\ln(X e^{-b\\Delta t_{1}}/S_{0})$ and $\\Delta t_{1}=5/365$ is the lag between the last\n\n<!-- Page:7 -->\n\ntrading day and the delivery day on PHLX options. By the properties of characteristic functions, the integral is real-valued and the probability can also be written as[^1]\n\n$$\nprob^*(S_T e^{b \\Delta t_1} > X \\mid F_j) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\text{imag}[F_j(i \\Phi) e^{-i \\Phi x}]}{\\Phi} \\, d\\Phi. \\tag{13}\n$$\n\nThe probability density function of $\\ln(S_{T}/S_{0})$ under the risk neutral probability measure has a similar form:\n\n$$\np^{*}(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F_2(i\\Phi) e^{-i\\Phi z} \\, d\\Phi \\\\ = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\text{real}[F_2(i\\Phi) e^{-i\\Phi z}] \\, d\\Phi \\tag{14}\n$$\n\nwhere $z\\equiv\\ln(S_{T}/S_{0})$\n\nThe integrals in Equations (13) and (14) can be evaluated efficiently via Gaussian quadrature. A Gauss-Kronrod rule based on IMSL subroutine DQDNG that evaluated $F_{j}(i\\Phi)$ at up to 87 points over a truncated domain was found to be accurate to $10^{-8}$ times the spot exchange rate (four orders of magnitude less than the minimum price change), except for extreme and implausible jump parameters. Since pricing call and put options of a common maturity and variance require the same values of $F_{j}(i\\Phi)$ regardless of the strike price/spot price ratio, enormous efficiency gains can be realized by evaluating all such options simultaneously.\n\nThe above procedure gives the price of a European option as a function of state variables and parameters:\n\n$$\nc(S, V, T; X, \\theta) = e^{-r(T+\\Delta t_i)} [FP_1 - XP_2] \\tag{15}\n$$\n\nfor $\\theta=\\langle\\lambda^{*},\\bar{k}^{*},\\delta,\\alpha,\\beta^{*},\\sigma_{\\nu},\\rho\\rangle$ . However, since the PHLX options on foreign currency are American, it is important, in principle, to take into account the extra value accruing from the ability to exercise the options prior to maturity. This study uses the constant-volatility analytic approximation from Bates (1991) for jump diffusions, modified forthe $4$ business day lag between early exercise of a PHLX option\n\n---\n\n[^5]: Issues of heterogenous international investors and deviations from purchasing power parity, which would involve including additional state variables for the distribution of weaith across heterogeneous agents, are being ignored here. More precisely, such effects are assumed here to affect only the foreign currency risk premium $E(d S/S)^{-}-(r-\\dot{r}^{*})=\\mu-b$ and therefore have no effect on option prices. The potential general equilibrium effects of the omitted state variables on interest rates and on volatility are ruled out by the imposed distributional assumptions. For an illustration of the (limited) general equilibrium impact of investor heterogeneity on interest rates see Dumas (1989).\n\n[^6]: The specification of the risk neutral process depends on the choice of numeraire. The above specification of Equations (2) and (3) is the risk neutral process for the $\\$/\\mathsf{FC}$ exchange rate $s$ to be used in generating dollar-denominated prices of foreign currency options. For foreign-currency denominated option prices expressed in terms of the $\\mathbf{FC}/\\S$ exchange rates $1/S$, it is necessary to use the marginal utility of foreign-currency denominated wealth $\\bar{J_{u},*}=S\\bar{J_{u}}$, when computing $\\Phi_{\\nu}$, $\\lambda^{*}$, and $\\bar{k}^{\\star}$. An Ito's lemma-based transformation of variables of the process in Equation (2) using $z\\equiv S^{-1}$ is not correct, because of Siegel's paradox.\n\n[^7]: The additional restriction that the process for optimally invested wealth follows a geometric volatility/jump-diffusion process with constant parameters is also required. See Ingersoll(1987, chap. 18) for a discussion of a similar issue with regard to the term structure of interest rates.\n\n[^8]: Strict linearity of the volatility risk premium can be supported under log utility when exchange rate volatility and market risk have a common component of a particular form. The linear specification will not typically emerge under more general preferences (e.g.,time-separable power utility) and should be viewed for such preferences as an approximation to the true functional form. Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) use a similar approximation when modeling the risk premium on interest rates.\n\nThe real part of $F(i\\Phi)$ is an even function of $\\Phi$ the imaginary part is an odd function. Inversion formulas are discussed in Kendall, Ord, and Stuart (1987, vol. 1, chap. 4).\n\nExtreme values of $\\bar{\\pmb{k}}$ (e.g., 30,000 percent) made $F(i\\Phi)$ highly oscillatory, and reduced accuracy to $10^{-5}\\times S$,which is still an order of magnitude less than the minimum tick size. Accuracy was measured by comparing option prices with those evaluated to $10^{-10}$ accuracy using IMSL's adaptive Gaussian quadrature subroutine DQDAGI for integrating functions over a semi-infinite domain.\n\n<!-- Page:8 -->\n\nand delivery of the underlying currency:\n\n$$\nP(S, V, T; X) \\approx  \\begin{cases}  p(S, V, T; X) + XA_1 \\left(\\dfrac{S/X}{y_p^*}\\right)^{q_1} & \\text{for } S/X \\geq y_p^* \\\\ e^{-r\\Delta t_2}(X - Se^{b\\Delta t_2}) & \\text{for } S/X < y_p^* \\end{cases} \\tag{16}\n$$\n\n$$\nC(S, V, T; X) \\approx \\begin{cases}  c(S, V, T; X) + XA_2 \\left(\\dfrac{S/X}{y_c^*}\\right)^{q_2} & \\text{for } S/X < y_c^* \\\\ e^{-r\\Delta t_2}(Se^{b\\Delta t_2} - X) & \\text{for } S/X \\geq y_c^*  \\end{cases} \\tag{17}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta t_{2}$ is the delivery lag on early exercise (4/365 if Monday, 6/365 otherwise);\n\n$$\nA_1 = e^{-r\\Delta t_2}(1 - y_p^* e^{b\\Delta t_2}) - p(y_p^*, V, T; 1);\n$$\n\n$q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are the negative and positive roots to\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\bar{V} q^{2} + \\left( b - \\lambda^{*} \\tilde{k}^{*} - \\frac{1}{2} \\bar{V} \\right) q - \\frac{r}{1 - e^{-rT}} + \\lambda^{*} \\left[ (1 + \\tilde{k}^{*}) q e^{\\frac{1}{2} q (q-1) \\delta^{2}} - 1 \\right] = 0 \\tag{18}\n$$\n\n$\\bar{V}$ is the expected average variance over the lifetime of the option conditional on no jumps:\n\n$$\n\\bar{V} \\equiv \\frac{1}{T} E \\int_{0}^{T} V_{t} \\, dt = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta^{*}} + \\left( V_{0} - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta^{*}} \\right) \\frac{1 - e^{-\\beta^{*}T}}{\\beta^{*}T} \\tag{19};\n$$\n\n$y_{p}^{*}$ , the critical spot price/strike price ratio for immediate exercise of puts, is given implicitly by\n\n$$\ne^{-r\\Delta t_2}(1-y_p^*e^{b\\Delta t_2}) = p(y_p^*, V, T; 1)-\\left(\\frac{y_p^*}{q_1}\\right) [e^{(b-r)\\Delta t_2}+p_s(y_p^*, V, T; 1)] \\tag{20}\n$$\n\nand $y_{c}^{*}$ , the critical spot price/stike price ratio for immediate exercise of calls, is given by\n\n$$\ne^{-r\\Delta t_2}(y_c^* e^{b\\Delta t_2}-1) = c(y_c^*, V, T; 1)+\\left(\\frac{y_c^*}{q_2}\\right)[e^{(b-r)\\Delta t_2}-c_s(y_c^*, V, T; 1)]. \\tag{21}\n$$\n\nStrictly speaking, the approximations for the early exercise premiums were derived for constant-volatility jump diffusions.

The approximation error is substantially smaller for shorter-maturity put options and for puts with different strike prices. Approximation error is negligible for call options of all maturities considered, given U.s. interest rates substantially higher than German rates over most of the data sample.",
"text_b": "---\n\n78\n\n<!-- Page:9 -->\n\nIumps and Stochastic Volatility: Exchange Rate Processes Implicit in Deutsche Mark Options\n\n## 2. Estimation\n\n### 2.1 Data\n\nTransactions data for deutsche mark foreign currency options were obtained for January 1984 to June 1991 from the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Prior to September 26, 1987, only options maturing in March, June, September, or December were traded, with contract specifications geared to the corresponding IMM foreign currency futures contracts in size (62,500 deutsche marks, half the size of the IMM futures contracts) and maturity (third Wednesday of the contract month). Trading in contracts maturing the nearest other two months began on September 27, 1987. The options are American, and could be exercised at any time up to and including the Saturday preceding the third Wednesday of the contract month.\n\nRoughly 1 percent of the records mildly violated early exercise constraints, presumably due to measurement error in matching up the underlying futures price. Since discarding these data would bias upward average in-the-money option prices, influencing the implicit parameter estimation, these data were retained. There was also no attempt to weed out thinly traded option contracts, apart from the fact that those contracts by their nature received a low weighting in the regressions. A few obviously erroneous data (0.1 percent of the total data) were discarded.\n\nOnly a subset of the full data set was used in this study. First, only trades on Wednesdays were considered, yielding a weekly frequency panel data set. Daily sampling would place extreme demands on computer memory and time, and would involve issues of modeling day-of-the-week volatility effects that I do not wish to explore at this time. Second, only morning trades (9 A.M. to 12 P.M. EST) were considered—a trade-off between shortening the interval for greater synchronicity and lengthening it to get more observations. Third, only options with March/June/September/December maturities and with 6 months or less to maturity were used—for a maximum of two option maturities per day. The resulting data set consists of 19,689 transactions (11,952 calls; 7,737 puts) on 372 Wednesday mornings.\n\n---\n\n14 Fifty percent of the daily trades over the period 1984 to 1991 took place between 9 A.M. and 12 P.M. The greatest activity was between 9 A.M. and 10:30 A.M., when U.S. and European markets were open simultaneously.\n\n<!-- Page:10 -->\n\n<center><i>Table 1 Prices of European and American put options in <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\\phi/\\mathbf{DM}\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; height: 1.2em;\" alt=\"\\phi/\\mathbf{DM}\" class=\"latex-formula\"/> evaluated by Fourier, finite-difference, and quadratic approximation method.
